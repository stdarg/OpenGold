# New wall art

The game's first-person view shows these sets in place of the original wall
appearances. Each folder is one original appearance, named after its key with
`.` and `:` written as `_`: `WALLDEF1_DAX_1_4` is appearance 4 of
`WALLDEF1.DAX` record 1. A folder holds ten PNGs, each four times the original
piece's size: `far_front`, `far_left`, `far_right`, `middle_front`,
`middle_left`, `middle_right`, `near_front`, `near_left`, `near_right`, and
`far_extension`. Its `manifest.json` records the brief the set was made from.

An appearance without a folder keeps its original art from the player's game
files, enlarged four times. The game refuses a folder it cannot use, such as
one with a missing piece or a piece of the wrong size.

The [Replacement Art Creator](../../../dev_tools/replacement_art_creator/README.md)
writes these folders with **Export to game**, and the
[Tile Art Viewer](../../../dev_tools/tile_art_viewer/README.md) shows them as
the game does. Every image here is new art; none is copied from the original
game.
