# Campaign migration fixtures

`campaign-v1.ogs` and `campaign-v2.ogs` retain the earlier authored campaign
formats used by the save tests.

`campaign-v6-low-con.ogs` was written by rules module 0.6.2, built from commit
`c59ce07`, before the HP-history correction. Do not regenerate it with the
current writer. It contains six level-four Wizards created through the normal
character/advancement APIs, with Sage bonuses excluding Constitution and a
level-four +2 Constitution increase:

| Member | Species | Starting Constitution | Old maximum/current HP | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Human | 3 | 6 / 6 | Healthy |
| 2 | Human | 3 | 6 / 4 | Wounded |
| 3 | Human | 3 | 6 / 0 | Unconscious, one success/two failures |
| 4 | Human | 3 | 6 / 0 | Dead, one success/three failures |
| 5 | Dwarf | 3 | 10 / 8 | Wounded |
| 6 | Human | 15 | 30 / 28 | Wounded; unaffected by the correction |

All have one remaining slot at each spell level. Migration must produce maxima
9, 9, 9, 9, 13 and 30; current HP 9, 7, 0, 0, 11 and 28; and preserve the resource
strings and dead flag. Subsequent saves must reload without applying the
correction again. The fixture uses no original game assets.
