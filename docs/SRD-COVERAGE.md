# SRD coverage ledger

This ledger tracks the [audit](audits/srd-5.2.1-rules.md) against the
[incremental plan](SRD-IMPLEMENTATION.md). The
[GitHub issue index](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/186) links every
planned increment and recurring work queue. All use `SRD_improvements`.
The all-twelve-class level-four milestone is
[#8](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/8).

The [level-four spell inventory](SPELL-INVENTORY.md) records **139 required
spells**, including source discrepancies between class tables and descriptions.
Twelve have partial playable paths and 127 are missing. It links grant routes,
dependencies, current evidence and bounded child issues; inventory work alone
does not close [#165](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/165).

## Wizard spell learning and preparation controls

Runtime `db864c8` (SRD module 0.6.51) completes
[#37](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/37) for the implemented Wizard
catalog through level four. WIZCHOICE-1/2/3 deliver independent creation choices,
two-page advancement, pending old-save knowledge in Spellbook, and preparation
plus one optional cantrip replacement after each completed Long Rest. Presets
receive pre-generated selections. Existing knowledge/preparation, wounds, spent
resources and equipment survive chronological replay and Review Training.

The [delivery packet](WIZARD-SPELL-CHOICES.md) records SRD source, frozen scope,
actual 0.6.50 writer fixtures, conditional campaign16/PC34 compatibility and
reproduction commands. All 51 native/tool and 26 Godot checks pass on the final
integrated tree. New creator/advancement/book/rest flows, keyboard/cancellation,
sequential Wizard choices and whole UI-save comparisons pass in main EN/ES and
demo EN at both supported sizes. 922 translated messages validate. Measured
preflight-to-verified-runtime-commit: 50m16s including approval wait/builds.

This delivers one original control-workflow requirement. No new issues or spell
effects were added. [#97](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/97) remains
open for physical books, copying costs/time and book replacement/loss;
[#165](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/165) retains missing spells.
SRD counts remain intact with unsupported selections visibly pending. Other
classes, Ritual Adept, Evoker and higher levels remain their existing issues.

## Wizard Scholar

Runtime `4ce541a` (SRD module 0.6.50) completes
[#100](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/100) through Wizard levels 2–4:
choose exactly one proficient skill from the six SRD candidates, gain sourced
Expertise, and retain it through advancement, combat and persistence. SCHOLAR-1's
level-two dropdown and old-save Review Training path preserve prior selections,
wounds and expenditure. Missing historical choices remain pending.

The [delivery packet](SCHOLAR.md) records source/acceptance, actual 0.6.49 writer
fixtures, conditional campaign15/PC33 compatibility, commands and limitations.
51 native/tool checks and 26 Godot runtime checks pass; Scholar and existing
Review Training UI flows pass, as do complete UI-save comparisons. Main EN/ES and
demo EN renders/input pass at both supported sizes; 907 translations validate.
Measured freeze-to-verified-runtime-commit: 29m36s, including approval wait/builds.
Ritual Adept, Evoker and broader Wizard integration remain separate requirements.

## Wizard Arcane Recovery

Runtime `642c7a1` (SRD module 0.6.49) completes
[#99](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/99) through Wizard levels 1–4:
legal expended-slot allocations after Short Rest, one use per Long Rest, exact
transactional expenditure and current/historical save continuation. AR-1's
shared Rest dropdown/button is keyboard accessible and preserves camp/inn saves.

The [delivery packet](ARCANE-RECOVERY.md) contains the source, fixed acceptance,
prior-writer provenance, architecture and measured timing. Final verification:
51 native/tool tests; 26 Godot runtime checks (43 entries with prerequisites);
game EN/ES and demo EN renders at 1120×800 and 1920×1080; 902 translations valid.
Other Wizard features and later progression remain separate requirements.

## Approved exception: unlimited ranged ammunition

The user explicitly declined ammunition tracking on 2026-09-25. [#57](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/57)
is no longer planned: a ranged weapon has unlimited ammunition, with no inventory
prerequisite, expenditure or recovery. This retains existing behavior, not newly
implemented SRD expenditure/recovery. Existing saved ammunition items remain
readable; physical Thrown weapons remain distinct. [Policy and evidence](AMMUNITION.md)
record the decision, runtime `79558fd`, all-class weapon tests and compatibility.
Do not reopen tracking as a missing SRD feature without explicit approval.

## Thrown weapon inventory

Runtime `5d7813d` (module 0.6.47) completes [#58](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/58):
all seven Thrown weapons can be drawn from real carried stacks, thrown once,
located on the target square on hit/miss, and retrieved through pickup or approved
safe recovery. The Q43/Q44 game/demo dropdown shows quantities and necessary
stowing. Core preserves quantities, inventory identities and provenance; the
static SRD library owns hand timing, rule outcomes and physical item locations.
[Thrown packet](THROWN-WEAPONS.md) records acceptance, compatibility and evidence.

All 49 native/tool tests and 26 Godot runtime checks pass (42 with prerequisites).
The matrix covers 154 supported weapon/class/level routes, million-unit stacks,
companion transfer, recovery, canceled/rejected operations and pending Savage/
Champion continuation. Main EN/ES and demo EN controls render and pass keyboard/
mouse checks at 1120×800 and 1920×1080; 896 localized messages validate.
Actual 0.6.46 fixtures remain unchanged. New physical encounters use combat 19;
older encounters retain their previous continuation, and campaign 11 is unchanged.
No other issue or excluded equipment property is claimed complete.

## Fighter Champion through level four

Runtime `6324a51` (module 0.6.46) completes [#88](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/88).
Ordinary Fighter level-three confirmation grants Champion; level four retains it.
Weapon and Unarmed Strike attacks critically hit on 19–20, Initiative and
Strength/Athletics gain Advantage, and each critical permits immediate optional
half-Speed movement without opportunity attacks or normal movement expenditure.
The Q41/Q42 game/demo controls preserve spent actions and interrupted movement;
existing level-three/four campaign saves gain the fixed grants during replay.
[Champion packet](CHAMPION.md) records acceptance, compatibility, limitations,
verification commands and timing. No future Athletics actions or spell-access
sources were added to this batch.

All 48 native/tool tests and 25 Godot runtime checks pass (40 with prerequisites).
Main EN/ES and demo EN rendered controls pass at 1120×800 and 1920×1080;
891 localized messages validate. Actual 0.6.45 writer fixtures prove prior combat
continuation, while campaign comparisons allow only approved fixed-grant additions
and existing migrations. Historical fixture bytes remain unchanged. Rules remain
in the statically linked SRD library, with no SRD arithmetic in Core or UI.

Measured start 15:26 UTC, focused checks/render review by 15:50, final native pass
by 16:04:31 and runtime committed at 16:06:21 on 2026-09-25: about 40 minutes to
verified runtime. One of one selected original requirements delivered, no added
issues or scope. Recorded Astra/high retained; no switch or agents. Token/cost
deltas unavailable. The packet records corrections and limits; the full SRD goal
remains active and incomplete.

## Medicine stabilization and Tactical Mind

Runtime revision `ce04673` (module 0.6.45) completes [#32](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/32)
and [#87](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/87). All twelve classes at
currently supported levels can attempt DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) stabilization;
Fighters gain Tactical Mind at level 2 and use the existing Second Wind pool
through level 4. Failed/declined checks spend the original Action, successful
boosts alone spend Second Wind, and stabilization never heals or wakes.
[Feature packet](MEDICINE-TACTICAL-MIND.md) records source/level coverage,
limitations, codecs, commands and the existing-check-path audit.

The approved Q38/Q39 controls work in game/demo with mouse, keyboard targeting,
Escape cancellation and exclusive failed-check decisions. Main EN/ES and demo EN
were rendered at 1120×800/1920×1080, including the combined Cunning/Wake/Stabilize
row. The main footer identifies the keyboard target; no combat-saving controls
were added. All calculations and resource decisions remain in the STATIC SRD
library. Core only selects the first rules-offered pending choice for AI.

Verification: all 47 native/tool tests, all 24 Godot runtime tests (38 with
prerequisites), focused graphical checks in both applications, and localization
of 886 messages pass on the delivered runtime tree. The last test-script change
only adds a screenshot and visible-footer assertion, also passing in both apps.
Actual 0.6.42/0.6.43 writer fixtures remain byte-identical; expected campaign
migrations add only the legitimate fixed Fighter grant, alongside existing
migrations. PC30 entitlement and pending combat17 states reject invalid old
identities and preserve RNG, spent Action type and targets. Existing checkpoint
shapes remain for states without a pending check. See the feature packet for logs.

Measured continuation: 14:46 UTC start, focused rules passing by 14:58, initial
renders by 15:04, full native pass by 15:20, final UI/render checks by 15:24:20
on 2026-09-25 (about 38 minutes since continuation). Implementation/review and
build phases overlap; no unique-effort sum is inferred. Original preflight start
04:41:34 and its approval wait remain recorded separately. Two of two selected
original requirements delivered; no new issues or expanded scope. Routing kept
the recorded Astra/high assignment, no model switch or delegation. Token/cost
deltas unavailable. Five old migration/profile expectations and two keyboard/
presentation gaps were corrected during verification; no repeated-fix escalation.

## Chill Touch class paths and healing prevention

Rules 0.6.44 completes the bounded class-cantrip increment under #165/#35:
Wizard levels 1–4 and level-one Sorcerer/Warlock choices and casting, melee
Necrotic damage, sourced healing prevention through the end of the caster's next
turn, and Q40's approved earned Stable recovery. [Mechanics, scope and evidence](CHILL-TOUCH.md)
include the actual grant routes, damage/action/component checks, all HP recovery
paths, death saves, overlapping effects, skipped caster turns, deterministic
campaign/combat continuation and old saves. SRD mechanics remain in the STATIC
library; Core and public interfaces have no changes. Existing Spell/Cast and
creator patterns are reused without new controls or combat save buttons.

Verification: tested runtime revision `0c76685`, delivered to `origin/main`,
passes all 46 native/tool checks and all 23 Godot runtime checks (36 with
prerequisites). The first regression run exposed a stale hard-coded module
identity in the Cunning Action test header; updating that assertion and rebuilding
made its native and dependent Godot checks pass. No runtime fix was required.
Actual frozen 0.6.43 saves were captured before the writer change. Prior EN/ES
combat and creator renders at 1120×800 and 1920×1080 remain valid because Q40
changes no layout. Both applications rebuilt; demo sleep and creator checks are
recorded in the feature packet. Localization validates 876 messages.

Commands/evidence: native targets and `opengoldbox_test_project` built with
`cmake --build build/mac-check --target ... -j6`; CTest native `-E '^opengold_godot_' -j6`
and Godot `-R '^opengold_godot_' -E '^opengold_godot_prepare$' --fixture-exclude-setup godot_project`.
Logs `/tmp/chill-final-native-{build,tests}.log`, `/tmp/chill-q40-godot.log`,
`/tmp/chill-q40-training-{build,test}.log`, `/tmp/chill-q40-cunning.log` and
`/tmp/chill-q40-demo-{build,sleep,creator}.log`. Focused checks also cover the
shared recovery timeline and legacy clocks (`/tmp/chill-earned-{build,tests}.log`).

Delivered one bounded spell increment, no new issues or issue closures. The
inventory now has twelve partial playable spells and 127 missing; #165 and #35
remain open for their full acceptance. Object targeting, feat/species access and
higher class progression are explicitly incomplete. Routing retained the recorded
Astra/high assignment, no agents/model switch. Original start 04:56:05 UTC;
independent verification ended 05:28:59, followed by the Q40 approval wait.
Q40 work resumed 14:23:53; focused implementation/build passed by 14:32,
final application verification completed by 14:36:55 (13m02s after resumption).
Documentation/delivery followed. Token/cost deltas unavailable.

## Workflow maintenance — not SRD functionality

2026-09-24: adopted batch execution in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and
[workflow](SRD-WORKFLOW.md), with a compact [repository map](SRD-REPO-MAP.md),
[decision register](SRD-DECISIONS.md) and current batch card in the
[handoff](SRD-HANDOFF.md). Related requirements share implementation/evidence;
mandatory ticket splitting is superseded without reducing acceptance.
This ledger is the canonical completion record. Feature docs hold behavior and
durable evidence, the spell inventory holds source/coverage requirements, and
issue updates/handoff link here instead of reproducing delivery narratives.
Historical records are retained; new work follows this ownership convention.

Validation: local Markdown links, explicit map paths and named native test targets
resolve; conflicting old active-workflow phrases were removed; diff whitespace
checks pass. Documentation-only change: no game build or gameplay test rerun.
Observed implementation-to-verification interval: 21:52:55–21:56:28 UTC (3m33s);
earlier investigation timing is unknown, so this is not total task time.
No token saving or faster feature throughput is claimed yet. No SRD issues closed,
no compatibility reduction, no agents/new tasks/model changes; goal remains paused.

## Delivered batch B — rest workflow

#30/#193 are delivered with the reviewed #192 player rest controls. The existing campaign adapter's unverified high-chance
profiles now reject rather than masquerading as guaranteed city-watch events.
Independent regressions failed before the guard correction and pass afterward;
[scope and evidence](REST-RESOURCES.md#rest-batch-b-verified-profile-boundary).
Native resumable activity now records sleep/light/exertion, interruptions and Q32
fresh segments, rejects stale requests, and persists through format 12 while
retaining prior saves. Safe-camp/inn atomic callers consume the same engine.
[Mechanics, compatibility and tests](REST-RESOURCES.md#resumable-activity-persistence-and-evidence).
The complete combat-victory regression additionally preserves XP/loot across the
interrupted rest, save/load and completion; unrelated edits remain locked.
Original ECL damage and encounter requests now interrupt rests automatically;
earned recovery choices finish before combat starts, and committed dice survive
a rejected encounter. [Adapter scope and evidence](REST-RESOURCES.md#193-event-adapter-increment).
Natural sleep, waking and persistent Prone are implemented. Combat equipment drops, pickup, inventory transfer and saved detached items are implemented; natural-sleep camp drops now survive waking and interruption into combat; Q37 safe standing/collection and verified city-watch scheduling now complete #193/#30.
[Sleep/posture scope and evidence](REST-RESOURCES.md#natural-sleep-and-posture-increment-193-q3335).
[Combat equipment scope and evidence](REST-RESOURCES.md#combat-held-equipment-increment-193-q35).
[Camp equipment scope and evidence](REST-RESOURCES.md#natural-sleep-ground-equipment-at-camp-193-q35).
[Final safe recovery, city-watch behavior and complete verification](REST-RESOURCES.md#safe-recovery-and-city-watch-completion-193-q37).
Q29–35 and Q37 are approved; Q37 supersedes Q36. See the
[register](SRD-DECISIONS.md).

The shared game/demo Rest dialog now delivers Q29–31: Short/Long choice,
per-member eligibility/resources, sequential committed dice, Finish/Escape,
camp/inn saving, reload and retained-rest Resume/End. Original permissions and
inn payment remain authoritative. [Controls and acceptance evidence](REST-RESOURCES.md#player-rest-controls-192).
`opengold_godot_rest` exercises actual controls and keyboard actions; campaign
restart tests cover pending spending through the real save/load host.

## Delivered increments

| Increment / feature | Authority and supported scope | Implementation and verification | Persistence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#29 / #189](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/29): complete training grants and saved-choice review | All twelve starting class skill packages, supported background/tool/language grants, duplicate provenance and Expertise; Q28 Review Training completes missing saved choices. | [Training scope and reproducible checks](TRAINING.md#review-training-verification-29189). Shared game/demo dialog locks old choices, rejects advancement conflicts, supports keyboard/cancel and blocks combat. Native comparison proves only training changes. 44 native/tool tests, 20 registered Godot tests, game/demo review checks and all-class creator check pass; English/Spanish layouts inspected at both sizes. | Rules 0.6.40 / PC28, campaign 11 and combat 13–15 unchanged. Migrated prior-save wounds, resources, equipment, advancement and history retained. No new save controls or compatibility reduction. |
| [#228](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/228): Sorcerer starting cantrips | SRD pp.64–65,67; four explicit starting choices and Charisma casting through the implemented catalog. | [Scope/evidence](SORCERER-CANTRIPS.md); source/attack/effect/persistence cases and creator/combat checks. Complete catalog, leveled spells, Innate Sorcery and later levels remain #132. | Rules 0.6.40 / PC28; campaign 11, combat 13–15 and FX1–3 unchanged. Actual 0.6.39 prior writer retains exact continuation. |
| [#227](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/227): Warlock Poison Spray | SRD pp.75,153; explicit level-one Pact Magic source and Charisma casting. New presets fill both supported cantrips; old choices remain. | [Scope/evidence](WARLOCK-POISON-SPRAY.md), native source/attack/persistence and actual creator/dropdown casting. Later levels #160 and other sources #202 remain. | Rules 0.6.39 / PC27; campaign 11, combat 13–15 and FX1–3 unchanged. Actual 0.6.38 prior-writer continuation retained. |
| [#226](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/226): Wizard Shocking Grasp | SRD p.162; sourced Wizard levels 1–4, melee spell Lightning damage and target-turn Opportunity Attack suppression without spending/refunding Reactions. | [Scope and evidence](SHOCKING-GRASP.md); actual spell selection, combat controls, interrupted movement and campaign continuation. Parent #223 remains open for other sources. | Rules 0.6.38 / PC26 / FX3; campaign 11 and combat 13–15 unchanged; real 0.6.37 prior-writer fixtures. |
| [#224](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/224): level-one Warlock cantrip path | SRD pp. 71, 127; explicit Pact Magic cantrip selection and Charisma-based Eldritch Blast against creatures. | [Scope and evidence](ELDRITCH-BLAST.md); native rules/persistence, creator and combat controls. Objects #225, later levels #160 and parent #204 remain open. | Rules 0.6.37 / PC25; campaign 11 and combat 13–15 unchanged. Real 0.6.36 fixtures preserve old missing choices and continuation. |
| [I01 / E5](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/20): starting-class weapon proficiency | SRD 5.2.1 pp. 49, 61, 91. Rogue gains martial Finesse or Light; Monk gains martial Light. Applies to the implemented catalog, including Shortsword/Scimitar. Other starting-class grants remain intact. | [weapons.h](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/weapons.h) records Light; [srd5.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/srd5.cpp) uses the same training query for profiles, equipment notes and combat. [party_tests.cpp](../tests/party_tests.cpp), `class_weapon_proficiency`, verifies all twelve classes, actual +5 attacks for Dexterity-16 Rogue/Monk, equipment explanations and deterministic campaign/combat reload. The regression failed before the fix. | Module 0.6.1; campaign schema unchanged. Existing 0.6.0 and earlier supported campaigns reconstruct the corrected bonuses without losing equipment or wounds. [save_tests.cpp](../tests/save_tests.cpp) verifies 0.6.0 campaign upgrade. Standalone combat checkpoints require exact module identity. |
| [I02 / E2–E3](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/21): death-save turn entry and stabilization | SRD 5.2.1 pp. 17–18. An unstable actor at 0 HP rolls once on turn entry, including the initial initiative slot. A natural 20 permits the recovered actor's turn. Stabilization clears both counters. | [srd5.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/srd5.cpp) shares one turn-entry path. [rules_tests.cpp](../tests/rules_tests.cpp), `death_save_turn_entry_tests`, covers initial/later entry, all four outcomes, stable/dead skipping and deterministic checkpoint continuation. The regression failed before the fix. [party_tests.cpp](../tests/party_tests.cpp), `stabilization_handoff`, verifies campaign handoff and reload with spent resources preserved. | Module 0.6.2; campaign schema unchanged. Supports 0.6.1 and earlier supported campaigns. Legacy stable counters normalize when rules hydrate vitals. [save_tests.cpp](../tests/save_tests.cpp) verifies 0.6.0/0.6.1 campaign upgrades. Checkpoint restoration performs no turn-entry roll; standalone combat checkpoints still require exact module identity. |
| [I03 / E1](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/22): Constitution and HP history | SRD 5.2.1 p. 23. Gain fixed HP with the previous modifier before applying the Constitution increase per attained level. Prior minimum-one gains persist; Dwarven Toughness remains additive. | [character_rules.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/character_rules.cpp) initializes modifier history; [srd5.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/srd5.cpp) replays and validates it for advancement and combat profiles. [advancement_tests.cpp](../tests/advancement_tests.cpp), `hp_history`, verifies the 9-HP Wizard, odd/even modifier boundaries, Dwarves, wounds, unconsciousness, resource expenditure and campaign/combat reconstruction. The regression failed before the fix. | Module 0.6.3 and PC4 combat profiles; campaign format remains 6. Existing saved choices reconstruct history. A rules-owned migration preserves living HP deficits and zero-HP/dead state. [save_tests.cpp](../tests/save_tests.cpp), `hp_migration`, uses a [frozen 0.6.2 save](../tests/fixtures/README.md) to verify correction and reload without double application. Prior-module standalone combat saves still reject. |
| [I04 / E4](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/23): ability-bonus provenance | SRD 5.2.1 pp. 23, 83, 87. Background allocations and level-four Ability Score Improvement are distinct grants. | [character_rules.h](../src/OpenGold.Rules/include/opengold/character_rules.h) exposes source IDs, acquisition levels and individual amounts. Creation/advancement emit separate records; game and demo modifier dialogs render each contribution. [advancement_tests.cpp](../tests/advancement_tests.cpp), `ability_sources`, verifies Soldier +2 and feat +2, grants outside the background list, totals, preview/rejection and reload. Both Godot advancement checks verify actual dialog text and reconstruction; the new game regression failed before the fix. | Module 0.6.3, PC4 and campaign format 6 unchanged. Sources are derived by replaying existing saved choices, including the frozen prior-module fixture in [save_tests.cpp](../tests/save_tests.cpp). Numeric scores, vitals and combat continuation are unchanged. |
| [I05 / G12](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/24): remaining turn resources | SRD 5.2.1 pp. 13–14. Existing melee/ranged attacks and damaging spells preserve unused movement and Bonus Actions. Explicit End Turn advances initiative; AI uses available recovery and then ends. | [srd5.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/srd5.cpp) retains the turn after attacks/reaction resolution. [rules_tests.cpp](../tests/rules_tests.cpp), `turn_budget_tests`, covers all six offensive verbs, pre/post-attack movement, Second Wind, spell slots, spent-action rejection, ordered reactions and enemy completion. The regression failed before the fix. [party_tests.cpp](../tests/party_tests.cpp), `remaining_turn_handoff`, checks campaign time and spent recovery through completed combat and reload. [combat_view_tests.gd](../tests/combat_view_tests.gd) exercises actual ranged input, keyboard movement, End Turn and AI return. | Module 0.6.4; checkpoint 5 and campaign 6 unchanged. Post-attack/reaction checkpoints continue deterministically with no resource refund. Supported 0.6.3 and earlier campaigns migrate; prior-module combat checkpoints require the exact identity. |
| [I06 / G12](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/25): opportunity triggers and presentation facing | [SRD 5.2.1 p. 15](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf). Turning toward a weapon/spell target creates no reaction. Leave-reach movement still pauses before the step, respecting sight, Disengage and the reaction budget. Incapacitating the mover stops movement and the queue. | [srd5.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/srd5.cpp) removes runtime facing queues. [rules_tests.cpp](../tests/rules_tests.cpp) verifies left/right turns, party/enemy actors, every targeted offensive verb, ordered movement reactions, spent-reaction limits, interruption, atomic rejection and deterministic migration. The no-reaction regression failed before the fix. Existing status-effect tests verify Blinded visibility. [opportunity_view_tests.gd](../tests/opportunity_view_tests.gd) uses real Load/Save and keyboard controls to verify migrated facing, remaining movement and pending queues. | Module 0.6.5 / combat format 6. [Frozen 0.6.4 fixtures](../tests/fixtures/README.md) prove migration cancels only valid obsolete facing queues, invalidates their command tickets and preserves resources/time/RNG. Real movement retains partial queue position and matches the prior writer after resolution. Unrelated combat identities reject; supported campaigns through 0.6.4 upgrade with campaign format 6 unchanged. |
| [I07 / G12](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/26): allied transit | [SRD 5.2.1 p. 14](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf). Allied spaces are transit cells at normal terrain cost; every selected endpoint must be free. Hostile, size-dependent and general Incapacitated transit remain F13. | Shared [combat_grid.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/combat_grid.cpp) governs planning, execution and restore. The corridor regression failed before the fix. [combat_grid_tests.cpp](../tests/combat_grid_tests.cpp) checks normal/difficult allied costs, budget boundaries, walls and 9,686 exhaustive layouts. [rules_tests.cpp](../tests/rules_tests.cpp) covers both sides, successive allies, atomic occupied-stop rejection, shared-cell reactions, malformed overlap, knockdown, healing, death and natural-20 recovery. [party_tests.cpp](../tests/party_tests.cpp) verifies a real campaign fight and save/reload; the rendered Godot demo clicks across two allies and rejects an occupied arrow destination. | Module 0.6.6 / combat format 7 retains an involuntary-overlap marker so interrupted movement and later recovery reload correctly. Accepted paused routes validate their remaining budget and free endpoint. Supported 0.6.4/0.6.5 combat and campaign saves upgrade without refilling resources. Prone and size-dependent co-occupancy effects remain explicitly tracked in #35/#44; the marker is persistence state, not a claim that Prone is implemented. |
| [I08 / G9](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/27): Versatile grip | [SRD 5.2.1 pp. 90–91](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf). Quarterstaff/Spear use 1d6/1d8; Battleaxe/Longsword/Trident/Warhammer/War Pick use 1d8/1d10. Two hands affect melee only and require no shield. | Rules supply grip choices and validated commands; campaign inventory and Godot combat dropdowns persist selection. [versatile_tests.cpp](../tests/versatile_tests.cpp) checks all seven weapons, fixed normal/critical/miss dice, thrown attacks, atomic rejection, resource preservation, pending reactions and campaign handoff. [grip_view_tests.gd](../tests/grip_view_tests.gd) exercises layout, keyboard, dice and save/load; inventory integration checks cover shields and both grip choices. | Module 0.6.7 / PC5 / combat 8 / campaign 7 store selected hands separately from resources. [Frozen 0.6.6 files](../tests/fixtures/README.md) preserve the old four forced grips and other one-handed grips; migrated and new saves resume deterministically. Weapon/shield artwork remains the existing catalog; new poses and remaining equipment properties are outside I08. |
| [F01](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/28): feature and feat provenance | [SRD 5.2.1 pp. 47, 83, 87–88](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf). Soldier's Origin feat and the implemented level-four choices have separate entitlements; prerequisites, repeatability and ability choices are validated. | [feature_grants.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/feature_grants.cpp) centralizes creation grants, advancement sources, choices and validation. [feature_grant_tests.cpp](../tests/feature_grant_tests.cpp) covers all twelve Soldier classes, distinct sources, malformed/duplicate/prerequisite rejection, totals and saved continuation. Existing advancement checks exercise both acquired feats in the normal game/demo sheet. | Module 0.6.8 / campaign 8 / PC6 persist grant records and choices. Formats 1–7 reconstruct grants from creation/history; frozen 0.6.7 files verify wounds/resources/totals and exact combat continuation against the previous writer. Older combat recipes retain validated effects without invented provenance. New feats and complete class features remain separate increments; the starting Fighting Style selector is recorded below. |

| [F02a](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/187): training rules and persistence | [SRD 5.2.1 pp. 8–9, 20, 61–62, 83](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf).

[training_tests.cpp](../tests/training_tests.cpp) covers eligibility, overlap, proficiency boundaries, pending choices, malformed records and advancement totals. | Module 0.6.9 / campaign 9 / PC7. Frozen 0.6.8 saves verify pending choices, preserved wounds/resources and exact combat continuation. Creation controls #188 are delivered below; [saved-choice completion #189](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/189) remains open, so parent F02 is not complete. Other class/background packages and campaign skill uses remain separate. |

| [F02b](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/188): training creation controls | Uses the F02a choices and grants with the approved Training step after Class. Presets come with complete training; older saves retain pending choices. | Shared [training_control.h](../src/OpenGoldBox/training_control.h) serves the game/demo, with fixed grants, counts, keyboard access and sourced sheets. [training_tests.cpp](../tests/training_tests.cpp) verifies creator validation/pruning and all 48 presets with campaign round trips; [training_view_tests.gd](../tests/training_view_tests.gd) exercises real controls, focus/scrolling, dependencies and party handoff. Existing creator, party and Spanish localization checks cover the new step. | No module or save-format change. #189 remains open for Review Training; other class/background packages remain separate. Completion describes only the supported choices. [Scope](TRAINING.md). |

| [F03a](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/190): Hit Dice and rest resource rules | [SRD 5.2.1 pp. 47–48, 185, 187](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf).

See [scope and caller obligations](REST-RESOURCES.md). | Module 0.6.10 / SRD4 / combat 9; campaign 9 and PC7 unchanged. Frozen 0.6.9 files preserve old state and the prior writer’s opportunity-attack result, adding unspent dice only. [Campaign flow #191](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/191) is delivered below; [controls #192](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/192) remain open, so F03 is not complete. |

| [F03b](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/191): campaign rest transactions | SRD 5.2.1 pp. 185, 187. Individual active-member eligibility, precise Long Rest cooldowns, a completed hour before Hit Dice spending, another decision after each die, and zero-die completion. | [campaign_rest.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Core/src/campaign_rest.cpp) stages time/effects/resources atomically. [campaign_rest_tests.cpp](../tests/campaign_rest_tests.cpp) verifies mixed parties, reserves, effect/RNG timing, duplicate/expired requests, original camp restrictions, inn rollback and next combat. No UI layout changed. | Campaign 10 persists the completed spending window and revision ticket; old formats gain no pending entitlement. Resources remain module 0.6.10 / SRD4 / combat 9 / PC7. Save/load between rolls and malformed continuation rejection are covered. [Rest controls #192](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/192), [late interruptions/resumption #193](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/193) remain outside this delivery. |

| [F04a](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/194): mortality recovery clocks | SRD 5.2.1 pp. 17–18. Shared death-save, stabilization, damage and healing transitions; one rolled 1d4-hour Stable delay, combat elapsed countdown and exact next-turn death-save timing. | [life_cycle.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/life_cycle.cpp) stores value-based recovery state. [recovery_clock_tests.cpp](../tests/recovery_clock_tests.cpp) verifies golden RNG/rolls, deadlines, damage/healing, migration, rejected timers, campaign/combat persistence, training/advancement and pending reactions. No new controls. | Module 0.6.11 / SRD5 / combat 10; campaign 10 and PC7 unchanged. Frozen 0.6.10 saves preserve spent dice/slots, Stable and unstable members, a dead member, a reserve and pending movement. Legacy delays initialize without inventing elapsed time or rolling on load.

| [F04c](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/195): campaign recovery | SRD 5.2.1 pp. 17–18. Six-second death-save turns and one rolled Stable deadline continue through exploration, waits, rests and encounter boundaries. | [recovery_timeline.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/recovery_timeline.cpp) combines mortality and effect deadlines. [campaign_recovery_tests.cpp](../tests/campaign_recovery_tests.cpp) verifies fixed rolls, time partitions, reserves, saves, encounters, rest eligibility and failed-event rollback; the Godot route exercises a zero-HP companion and reserve through original camp/temple/inn callbacks. | Module 0.6.12; existing campaign 10 / combat 10 / SRD5 / PC7 schemas. No load-time rolls, double combat processing, rest benefits from natural recovery or UI changes. Completes #31; Help/Medicine remains #32. |

Typed damage; nonstacking resistance/vulnerability/immunity; type-specific rounding; Dwarf Poison resistance. | [damage.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/damage.cpp) resolves mixed damage and sourced defenses. [damage_tests.cpp](../tests/damage_tests.cpp) runs Poison attacks against Dwarves in all twelve classes, every supported weapon, Fire Bolt/Scorching Ray/Magic Missile, migration and malformed data. Existing Godot Modifiers/log presentation is reused. | Module 0.6.13 / PC8; campaign/combat 10 and SRD1–5 retained. Frozen 0.6.12 writer fixtures preserve resources, RNG, clocks and pending reactions; newly supported fixed resistance is sourced to the saved species. Temporary HP #34, remaining Dwarf traits #66 and full spell conformance remain separate. |

| [F05b1](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/196): Temporary HP native foundation | SRD 5.2.1 pp. 17–18. Separate sourced pool, explicit keep/replace, damage absorption after defenses, zero-HP consequences and individual Long Rest expiry. | [life_cycle.cpp](../src/OpenGold.Rules.Srd5/src/life_cycle.cpp) and [temporary_hp_tests.cpp](../tests/temporary_hp_tests.cpp) cover independent arithmetic, actual Poison combat, healing, training, advancement, PC/NPC/reserve rest, malformed state and prior-writer continuation. | Module 0.6.14 / combat 11 / SRD6; campaign 10 and PC8 retained. This is a native API foundation. [Orc Adrenaline Rush and reviewed controls #197](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/197) are delivered below; parent #34 stays open.

Existing Modifiers text is checked through the Godot creation flow in Spanish. | Module 0.6.19 / PC10; campaign 10/combat 12/SRD1–7 retained. Old campaigns recover only preset/history-backed selections; old combat retains its recorded access.

Light extra attacks, Monk Martial Arts, optional feature-granted proficiency,
multiclass-entry proficiency remain their own issues. EQ02 adds the complete
catalog and Rapier/Hand Crossbow proficiency examples; it does not establish
complete Rogue or Monk support.

Validation for I01: rebuilt and passed the five native suites for party, save,
rules, character and content behavior. No Godot layout or control code changed;
equipment explanation checks exercise the shared rules output.

Validation for I02: rebuilt and passed the rules, party, save, status-effect and
advancement native suites. No Godot layout or control code changed. Death saves
and natural recovery outside combat are now completed by [F04 #31](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/31);
the existing all-unconscious-party defeat policy remains unchanged.

Validation for I03: the rules, party, save, status-effect, advancement, character
and content native suites pass. The Godot GDExtension is rebuilt against the
updated shared character data. No UI layout or controls changed. Higher levels
and additional classes retain their separate advancement issues.

Validation for I04: advancement, save, character and party native suites pass;
game and demo Godot advancement checks pass with the installed original assets.
English/Spanish catalogs and the localization UI check pass. Existing dialogs
retain their layout and controls. The general feature/feat grant ledger is delivered in
[F01 #28](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/28).

level/options supported, code/tests, save version and any reviewed adaptation.
Do not mark a tracking issue complete solely because its first child works.

SRD-derived rules use the attribution in
[NOTICE](../data/rules/srd-5.2.1/NOTICE.md); see the
[official SRD 5.2.1](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf).

### Rogue level-two Cunning Action increment (#218)

Rogue ordinary advancement reaches level two (300 XP, fixed-average d8 HP,
source grant, preserved training/vitals). Bonus Action Dash/Disengage reuse the
shared movement and opportunity-attack lifecycle and have approved combat controls.
See [Cunning Action](CUNNING-ACTION.md) for acceptance evidence. Hide remains #219;
parent #113 and later Rogue advancement #116 remain open. Barbarian/Monk Unarmored
Defense was already present in character AC calculation and existing party tests;
no duplicate implementation was needed.

### Sneak Attack preparation (#220; parent #112 remains open)

Source-backed eligibility/progression helpers and genuine 0.6.35 Rogue
campaign/pending-hit baselines are prepared and tested. They are not connected
to live combat. Optional hit controls await Q25; source grants, per-turn state,
damage/decision integration, persistence and player-path verification remain.
Level-three/four acceptance is retained in #221, dependent on #116. See
[Sneak Attack](SNEAK-ATTACK.md); this foundation does not close a feature issue.

### Unconscious enemy transit (#222, bounded child of #44)

Existing zero-HP Unconscious creatures can be crossed by either side, with the
correct nonstacking Difficult Terrain cost and no occupied voluntary endpoints.
Search/execution share the occupancy model. Interrupted enemy overlap preserves
spent movement through recovery and reload. See [Unconscious transit](UNCONSCIOUS-TRANSIT.md).
Tiny/size differences, large footprints, other Incapacitated sources and the Prone
consequence remain tracked by #44/#45/#35; this increment does not close them.
