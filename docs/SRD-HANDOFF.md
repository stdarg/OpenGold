# SRD handoff

Updated 2026-09-24. **Goal active:** close all `SRD_improvements` issues, with
all twelve classes through level 4, then level 20 and multiclassing. Work one
bounded issue at a time using [SRD-WORKFLOW.md](SRD-WORKFLOW.md).
[Index](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/186), [plan](SRD-IMPLEMENTATION.md),
[coverage](SRD-COVERAGE.md). Query GitHub for counts; old snapshots are stale.

## Current increment

Branch `main`. #212 completes Acolyte Insight, Religion and Calligrapher's Supplies,
and Soldier Athletics and Intimidation. See [background training](BACKGROUND-TRAINING.md)
for scope, migration and verification. Parents #61/#64 retain missing feat,
Gaming Set and equipment/wealth choices. #211 Sage and #210 Dwarven Toughness
explanation were previously delivered (`0004064`, `490ed19`).

Rules 0.6.27 / PC16 / FX2; combat 13–15 and campaign 11 are unchanged.
Old profiles keep their validation catalog; campaign replay adds owed fixed
background grants. Actual 0.6.26 fixture provenance is in tests/fixtures/README.md.
Main entry points: rules `training.{h,cpp}`, `srd5.cpp`, Godot `training_control.h`,
`tests/training_tests.cpp`, `tests/training_view_tests.gd`, `tests/campaign_fixture.h`.

## Next work and pending questions

[Silence combat/area integration #208](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/208)
and [campaign/ritual integration #209](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/209)
remain dependent on unanswered questions 19–21. Do not re-ask or implement their
dependent choices without answers. These requests cite AGENTS.md for controls
and explicit review for geometry:

- Q19: flat grid; square center within 120 feet, circular 20-foot radius, whole
  occupied square determines full containment, walls block spread; preview
  distinguishes partial squares and fully contained creatures. No height model.
- Q20: prepared “Silence — level 2” in existing Spell dropdown; Cast enters area
  preview, arrows move it, Enter/click commits, Escape cancels free. New row below
  Dash shows End concentration, spell and duration. Release costs no action and
  is available for the selected owner outside their turn.
- Q21: Silence in current level 3–4 Cleric preparation choices, retaining current
  limits/confirmation; explicit choice only, no change to saved preparations.

Concentration lifecycle #207 and isolated CN1 codec are delivered; CN1 is not
embedded in live saves. See [CONCENTRATION.md](CONCENTRATION.md).
#205 Ray of Frost remains partial for other grant routes and #39 speech blockers;
see [RAY-OF-FROST.md](RAY-OF-FROST.md). Mundane gagging remains separate.
Continue independently actionable backlog work while these questions are pending.

## Decisions to preserve

- Saves only at camp/inn; no player combat-save controls. Internal continuation
  fixtures/checkpoints are permitted.
- Missing old training selections remain pending. Review Training #189 has
  unanswered layout question 11; retrieve its wording if needed. Presets must
  have pre-generated training selections.
- Approved creation steps: Training, then class-driven Spell Choices, then Name.
  Back keeps valid selections; unsupported catalog choices remain pending.
- Q18 approved and delivered: shared Spell dropdown and Cast in the existing
  combat row to the right of Adrenaline Rush; known cantrips, legal target preview,
  keyboard access, A/Space cycle and disabled unavailable casting. Reuse approval.
- Grip, HP source tooltips/colors, Temp HP replacement, Adrenaline Rush, Savage
  Attacker two-stage choice and Action Surge controls are approved; see feature docs.
- Play `/System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff` with `/usr/bin/afplay` before numbered
  questions. Batch related questions and reuse approvals. Fixed data displayed
  by existing controls does not require another layout approval.

## Environment and verification

Bash/macOS. `build/mac-check` is the main build, `build/sprite-demo` separate.
Godot: `/Applications/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`; project:
`src/OpenGoldBox/godot`; local original assets: `/Users/edmond/POOLRAD`.
Run Godot tests serially (shared checkpoint paths). Prepare the project once after
native/localization changes; see workflow for fixture exclusion and test commands.
Finished creation training appears in `Description`, not `ModifiersModal`.
Refresh locale-dependent creator text with Back/Next after changing locale.

#212: 40 native/tool checks, final focused training, 16 Godot runtime checks plus
seven fixture prerequisites pass. Main/demo builds and 747-message localization
check pass. Actual creation/party flow passes; both backgrounds inspected at both
sizes in English/Spanish. No live test/build processes remain. Evidence in
BACKGROUND-TRAINING.md; captures are local `/tmp/opengold-backgrounds-renders`.
