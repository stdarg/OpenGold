# SRD handoff

Updated2026-09-26. Standing goal remains incomplete: close all `SRD_improvements`,
preserving all twelve classes through4 and planned higher levels/multiclassing.
The goal tracker still says **blocked** from the former approval wait; this
assistant cannot set it active and has not paused it. Authorized implementation
continued. No agents/new tasks or model/runtime changes authorized.

## Latest delivery: Alert (#74)

Branch `codex/srd-alert`, implementation2320701 pushed. #74 CLOSED at
16:39:33 UTC; GitHub GraphQL confirms141 open SRD issues. Rules0.6.61/PC40/combat26.
All ALERT-1 behavior is implemented.51/51 native tests PASS9.06s, mainEN/ES and
demoEN actual keyboard/mouse controls pass both sizes; creation, advancement and
neighboring controls pass.1014 messages validate. No live build/test; no unchecked
runtime edits. [Canonical completion](SRD-COVERAGE.md#alert-complete-74),
[feature/evidence](ALERT.md). Approximately26 minutes from approval to closure;
preflight/wait excluded. Main remains375f58f; no merge/release claimed.

Previous Weapon Mastery delivery80ce54b and #60/#85 closures remain complete:
[canonical record](SRD-COVERAGE.md#weapon-mastery-integration-complete-6085).
Do not redo it. #84 starting equipment and #89 other Fighter4 acceptance remain.

## Next: Skilled (#77), B01

[Fixed packet and concrete control proposal](SKILLED.md). No implementation has
started. SKILLED-1 is the single pending control question, displayed as question1
with Glass audio. It adds a Skilled Training page to the existing level-up window.
No Human selector, new entitlement, equipment policy or crafting action is added.
The packet includes four missing SRD tool **proficiency** entries needed by the
feat's unrestricted choices. No new issues or silent prerequisite expansion.

After approval, branch from this completed delivery, capture actual0.6.61 writer
fixtures before changing the writer, then implement the recorded packet. Current
libraries are0.6.61. Read SRD-WORKFLOW, SRD-MODEL-ROUTING and the packet after resets.
Requested Astra/high for sourced repeatable choices and persistence; actual
runtime selection unverified. One owner, no delegation. Preflight16:40:50 UTC;
record approval continuation time and checkpoint before coding. A decision reply
does not resume a paused goal; this goal was not paused by this continuation.

## Standing constraints

Camp/inn saves only; unlimited ammunition (AMMO-UNLIMITED). No agents/new tasks,
settings changes, compatibility cuts or silent scope growth. Finish build inputs
before building; rebuild affected targets before tests; Godot runs serially.
Commit/push owned verified work and close only full original acceptance.
Questions restart at1 per set; play `/usr/bin/afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff`
and write every question visibly. #97 spellbooks/copying and #165 missing spells
remain; #98/#101/full Wizard remain open. Q19–21 are separate pending decisions;
Q23 was superseded by STYLE-1. Do not reload the entire historical conversation.
