# SRD decision register

Authoritative working register of user decisions; updated 2026-09-24 from the
conversation and feature/handoff records. These entries summarize approved scope,
not verbatim transcripts. Preserve question IDs. If exact missing wording matters,
retrieve it before coding; do not reconstruct an approval from a summary.
A reply resolves only its question and does not resume a paused goal.

## Current execution agreement

The SRD goal resumed on 2026-09-25 for #193. Earlier workflow maintenance did
not itself authorize resumption. The user requires no silent scope expansion: defer new
work, or obtain explicit approval if an out-of-scope dependency blocks delivery.
Use fixed batches, approved controls, targeted reads, edits completed before
builds, focused checks and one appropriate final regression pass. Report actual
player outcomes and elapsed time at a 60-minute checkpoint (90-minute maximum).
See [workflow](SRD-WORKFLOW.md) for the batch card and enforcement steps.
Questions remain numbered, visible in conversation and preceded by sound.

## Model routing adoption

The user explicitly requested a durable model routing policy for this goal.
[SRD-MODEL-ROUTING.md](SRD-MODEL-ROUTING.md) defines assignments, mandatory visible
selection, compact work packets, escalation after two unsuccessful fixes and
measurement of actual delivery cost. Creating the policy does not resume the goal
or authorize spawning agents/new tasks. Preserve the existing scope and approval
rules; do not silently change model settings.

## Rest workflow approval

Q29–31 are approved by the user's “Yes to all. Get to work.” This authorizes the
rest picker, sequential Hit Die controls and resumption dialog. Current run status
is recorded in the handoff; these control approvals remain valid.
Future questions must be written directly in the conversation, not only in a
question widget, and preceded by the audible Glass alert.

| ID | Decision | Approved scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q29 | #30/#192/#193 Rest picker | Camp [C] opens centered Short/Long dropdown, party eligibility/HP/dice/recharge list, Start/Cancel; preserve camping restrictions and paid inn Long Rest flow; keyboard. Approved; user confirmed all three controls. |

| Q33 | #193 natural sleep wake-up policy | Damage wakes recipient; adjacent ally may spend an Action to wake; explicit campaign loud-noise event wakes affected sleepers; initiative alone does not wake. Approved by the user's “33. Yes.” on 2026-09-25. |

| Q37 | #193 safe recovery | Approved: after victory or safe camping completion, cancellation, or obeying the city watch, able characters stand and collect reachable dropped party equipment. Return items to original owner, or a surviving companion if dead. Waking during combat retains Prone and ground equipment; normal standing/pickup costs remain. |

## Chill Touch recovery approval

| ID | Issue / decision | Approved scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q40 | #165 Chill Touch natural recovery | APPROVED by “40. Yes”: if the already-rolled Stable recovery deadline arrives during healing prevention, defer its 1 HP recovery until prevention expires without another d4-hour roll; damage still cancels Stable/recovery. |

## Medicine and Tactical Mind controls

| ID | Issue / decision | Approved scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q38 | #32 Medicine stabilization control | Stabilize beside Wake ally in a compacted Cunning Action row; highlight living unstable creatures at 0 HP within 5 feet/clear path, including enemies; Help Action and DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine), training applies; success stabilizes without healing/waking, failure still spends Action; keyboard, Escape cancel and disabled illegal use. APPROVED 2026-09-25: user answered Yes / Approve Tactical Mind dialog. |

## Champion approvals

| ID | Issue / decision | Approved scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q41 | #88 Champion acquisition | APPROVED 2026-09-25: existing level-three Fighter confirmation names Champion and grants features on Confirm; old level-three/four Fighters gain the same fixed grants through replay, preserving choices/wounds/equipment/resources.

Game/demo, no combat saving. |

## Approved patterns and policies

| Reference | Scope that may be reused | Limit / evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial four decisions | Preserve remaining turn resources; SRD opportunity triggers without facing reactions; allied transit; Versatile grip/damage/shield behavior | [Implementation plan](SRD-IMPLEMENTATION.md); these do not settle unrelated campaign policies. |
| Q1 / Grip | Labeled one/two-hand dropdown with actual dice, keyboard, immediate persistence; two hands unavailable with shield | [Implementation plan](SRD-IMPLEMENTATION.md). |
| Old-save training / Q9–10 | Keep missing choices pending; approved Training step after Class and before Name; Back keeps valid choices, invalid choices pruned; presets pre-generate their training | [Training](TRAINING.md). Q11 superseded by approved Q28. |
| Q5–7 / HP, Adrenaline and saving | HP colors/source tooltips and separate Temporary HP; Adrenaline Rush beside Dash; **player saves only at camp/inn** | [Temporary HP](TEMPORARY-HP.md). Internal combat checkpoint tests permitted; no player combat Save/Load controls. |
| Q8 | Two-stage Savage Attacker hit/damage-choice dialog, keyboard, action/reaction retained as spent | [Savage Attacker](SAVAGE-ATTACKER.md). Does not approve Sneak Attack's new decision order. |
| Q12–16 | Wizard/Cleric Spell Choices; supported selections, counts, Back, pending catalog choices, preset choices; approved casting row | [Cantrip controls](CANTRIP-CONTROLS.md), [Sacred Flame](SACRED-FLAME.md). |
| Q17 | Action Surge beside Adrenaline Rush, remaining uses, disabled when unavailable, keyboard | [Action Surge](ACTION-SURGE.md). |
| Q18 | Shared labeled Spell dropdown and Cast in existing combat row; known cantrips, legal target preview, keyboard and A/Space cycle | [Cantrip controls](CANTRIP-CONTROLS.md). Replaces individual spell buttons; adding fixed data in this pattern needs no repeated layout question. |
| Q22 | Fighter starting Fighting Style dropdown in Training, initially Archery/Defense; required selection, Back, keyboard, presets, old missing choice pending | [Fighter styles](FIGHTER-STYLES.md). Not blanket approval of future independent selectors. |
| Q24 | Rogue level-two Cunning Action row below combat buttons: dropdown and Use Bonus Action; Dash/Disengage initially, keyboard, turn/budget restrictions | [Cunning Action](CUNNING-ACTION.md). Hide requires its actual rule/target behavior. |
| Q26 | Warlock existing Spell Choices pattern and Spell/Cast; presets, retained old selections | [Eldritch Blast](ELDRITCH-BLAST.md), [Warlock Poison Spray](WARLOCK-POISON-SPRAY.md). |
| Q32 | Repeated Long Rest interruptions grant Short Rest benefits only for a fresh uninterrupted segment of at least one hour; earlier credited time cannot qualify again. Each interruption adds one required hour. | Approved for #193; 70-minute/10-minute/60-minute example in user reply. |
| Q28 | #29/#189 Review Training button beside Grip below inventory, visible for missing training; centered dialog reuses checkbox groups and Fighting Style dropdown, fixed grants, counts and keyboard; locks prior choices; Apply requires all supported choices; Cancel/Escape discards; combat blocks edits; preserve wounds/resources/equipment/advancement | Approved; supersedes pending Q11. |
| Q27 | Sorcerer existing Spell Choices and Spell/Cast with four supported cantrips, Charisma, presets, old selections pending | [Sorcerer cantrips](SORCERER-CANTRIPS.md). |
| Workflow adoption | User authorized efficiency implementation after backlog review | Batch workflow adopted; later pause takes precedence. #192 is closed; #30/#193 remain open. No authorization to discard save compatibility, create a fresh task or spawn agents. |

Before a new question, check this register and the relevant feature doc. Ask a
numbered question only for a material undecided layout/control/policy choice,
with concrete options. Play `/usr/bin/afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff`.
Append new decisions here once; other documents should link to this register.
