# Levels 5–10: SRD 5.2.1 inventory for OpenGold

Planning inventory for raising the cap from level 4 to level 10 for the twelve
SRD classes and their twelve SRD subclasses ([plan](LEVELS-5-10.md), #176). It
is a factual extract plus a proposed spell triage. Nothing here is a decision:
every KEEP, CUT and UNSURE is a proposal; decisions are recorded in
[SRD-DECISIONS](SRD-DECISIONS.md).

**Sources.** [SRD 5.2.1](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf), extracted with `pdftotext`. Page numbers are
the printed page numbers in the page footers ("NN System Reference Document
5.2.1"). I checked them against the PDF: PDF page N carries footer N (pp. 107,
150 and 175 checked). The two-column layout mixes text in the extraction, so
every spell entry was re-read from a single-column (`pdftotext` reading-order
or column-cropped) extraction of the same PDF. Repo context: `docs/SRD-DECISIONS.md`
(DM-1, DM-2, DM-3, SCOPE-1, SCOPE-2, CLASS-2, CLASS-10, CLASS-11, COVER-1,
MELEE-1, HIDE-1), `docs/SPELL-INVENTORY.md` and `docs/audits/srd-5.2.1-rules.md`
at `c4076002`.

**Already decided upstream (no new approval needed):** DM-2 (2026-09-30)
already cuts these level 3–5 spells by name: Clairvoyance, Major Image,
Sending, Speak with Dead, Tongues (level 3); Divination, Hallucinatory Terrain
(level 4); Commune, Contact Other Plane, Dream, Geas, Legend Lore, Modify
Memory, Scrying, Seeming (level 5). That is 15 of the 42 proposed cuts. DM-2
also cuts features that exist only to cast such spells. It names the Warlock's
Contact Patron as an example.

## Summary

### Spell counts (levels 3–5)

All **114** SRD spells of levels 3–5 (42 + 34 + 38) are on at least one of
the eight caster lists. Every one is reachable by level 10, because the full
casters and the Warlock all get level 3 slots at 5, level 4 slots at 7 and
level 5 slots at 9. Paladin and Ranger reach level 2 spells at 5 and level 3
spells at 9; they reach no level 4–5 spell by 10. The class-table union
matches the spell-description headers exactly. Unlike levels 0–2 (Phantasmal
Force, Mind Spike), there is no list/description mismatch at these levels.

| Spell level | KEEP | CUT | UNSURE | Total |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 3 | 22 | 16 | 4 | 42 |
| 4 | 24 | 9 | 1 | 34 |
| 5 | 17 | 17 | 4 | 38 |
| **All** | **63** | **42** | **9** | **114** |

UNSURE (9): Animate Dead, Magic Circle, Plant Growth, Tiny Hut (level 3);
Faithful Hound (level 4); Animate Objects, Mislead, Reincarnate, Telekinesis
(level 5).

### Biggest new systems needed

1. **Progression plumbing.** XP to 64,000; Proficiency Bonus +3 at 5 and +4
   at 9, reaching every derived number (the audit, G6, says +2 is hard-coded);
   spell slots of levels 3–5; Pact slots of levels 3–5; upcasting to those
   levels; a second ASI/feat (8, plus Fighter 6 and Rogue 10); cantrip
   upgrades at character level 5 (for example, Fire Bolt 2d10 on p. 132,
   Eldritch Blast two beams on p. 127).
2. **Extra Attack.** Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Paladin and Ranger at 5. The
   Thirsting Blade invocation gives it too (Warlock 5+, Pact of the Blade).
   The repo has no Extra Attack code yet (a grep of `src` finds none). It must
   work with Weapon Mastery, Cleave, Horde Breaker, Flurry of Blows, Sneak
   Attack's once per turn and the Barbarian's Brutal Strike.
3. **Auras and moving emanations.** Paladin Aura of Protection (6), Aura of
   Devotion (7), Aura of Courage (10); Spirit Guardians, Aura of Life,
   Conjure Minor Elementals, Conjure Woodland Beings, Antilife Shell, Conjure
   Animals (a movable zone). These need on-enter, start-of-turn and
   end-of-turn triggers with "once per turn" limits. Moonbeam, Spike Growth,
   Web and Flaming Sphere suggest part of this exists.
4. **Persistent areas and walls.** Cloudkill (drifts), Insect Plague, Sleet
   Storm, Stinking Cloud, Black Tentacles, Guardian of Faith, Call Lightning;
   and walls with sides and line crossing: Wall of Fire, Wind Wall (deflects
   missiles), Wall of Stone, Wall of Force.
5. **Summons and controlled creatures.** Giant Insect, Summon Dragon, Animate
   Objects, Animate Dead and Find Steed (Paladin 5) are allies that act after
   the caster. Dominate Beast and Dominate Person need player control of an
   enemy. SCOPE-2 keeps "only spells that actually create creatures" in scope
   for companions (#173). A grep of `src` finds no summon code.
6. **Dispelling and countering.** Dispel Magic, Counterspell (a reaction to a
   creature beginning a cast, so monsters must cast), Remove Curse, Greater
   Restoration, Dispel Evil and Good. These need a per-target registry of
   ongoing spells and curses.
7. **New states and conditions.** Ethereal (Blink); banished (Banishment);
   sealed (Resilient Sphere); polymorphed others (Polymorph); Haste's extra
   action and lethargy; Slow's action limits; Confusion's behavior table;
   Exhaustion and Petrified (Greater Restoration removes them, and Tireless
   lowers Exhaustion; the grep finds neither); Stunned (Stunning Strike);
   Evasion.
8. **Resurrection** (kept by SCOPE-2, #175; the grep finds no code):
   Revivify within 1 minute (a combat use), Raise Dead (-4 to D20 Tests,
   recovering 1 per Long Rest), Reincarnate (UNSURE); Death Ward and Aura of
   Life as 0-HP protection.
9. **Long buffs that outlast a fight.** Death Ward (8 h), Stoneskin (Conc 1 h),
   Protection from Energy (Conc 1 h), Freedom of Movement (1 h), Fire Shield
   (10 min) and Contagion (up to 7 days). CLASS-2 currently ends Concentration
   when combat ends and tracks it in combat only.
10. **More reactions.** Barbarian Retaliation, Rogue Uncanny Dodge, Bard
    Countercharm, Counterspell; Fighter Indomitable and Fiend Dark One's Own
    Luck as post-roll choices. The memory note "no perfect-information
    automation" applies: prompt for them, or follow BARD-1's public-information
    pattern.

### Features that cannot work without systems the game lacks

- **Mounts.** Paladin **Faithful Steed** (5, free Find Steed): a mount with
  mounted combat (SRD p. 130). SCOPE-1 dropped the mounted Lance rules. The
  steed's Fly Speed needs a level 4+ spell, so it never flies by level 10.
  Phantom Steed (level 3) is also a mount.
- **Flight.** The Fly spell (and Draconic Sorcery always prepares it at 5);
  Druid Wild Shape fly forms from level 8 (p. 42; SCOPE-2 says no fly forms);
  the Dragonborn's Draconic Flight at character level 5 (p. 84). Fly Speeds on
  the Giant Insect (wasp) and Draconic Spirit stat blocks go unused.
- **Movement modes the map lacks.** Monk Acrobatic Movement (9: walls and
  liquids; SCOPE-2 already cuts it); Ranger Roving's Climb and Swim Speeds (6;
  SCOPE-2 keeps only the +10 ft); Gift of the Depths; Water Walk, Water
  Breathing, Tree Stride, Meld into Stone, Gaseous Form, Passwall.
- **Telepathy and remote senses.** Telepathic Bond, Sending, Dream; the Gaze
  of Two Minds invocation; Arcane Eye and Visions of Distant Realms;
  Clairvoyance and Scrying. The Dominate spells' "telepathic link" can be
  treated as plain control.
- **DM-adjudicated features.** Contact Patron (Warlock 9; DM-2 cuts it by
  name), Whispers of the Grave (Speak with Dead), Ascendant Step (Levitate,
  cut by DM-3), Master of Myriad Forms (Alter Self, cut by DM-3) and Investment
  of the Chain Master (Pact of the Chain was removed by DM-1).
- **Cut by an earlier decision.** Wizard Evocation Savant's free spell at each
  new slot level (SCOPE-2), Rogue Supreme Sneak's "Three-Quarters Cover"
  condition (COVER-1 leaves only total cover), Arcane Hand's Grasping Hand
  (grappling dropped) and Interposing Hand (no Half Cover).

### Open decisions this inventory surfaces

1. **Costly consumed components.** CLASS-11 removed all spell components. That
   makes Revivify (300 gp), Raise Dead (500 gp), Greater Restoration and
   Stoneskin (100 gp each), Glyph of Warding (200 gp) and Magic Circle (100 gp)
   free. Is free resurrection intended?
2. **Pre-fight buffs.** Should long buffs (Death Ward, Stoneskin, Protection
   from Energy, Freedom of Movement) cast in camp persist into the next fight?
   CLASS-2 ends Concentration at the end of combat.
3. **Summons and control.** Approve one shared "allied creature takes its turn
   after its caster" system for Giant Insect, Summon Dragon, Animate Objects,
   Animate Dead and Dominate Beast/Person? Or defer some of them?
4. **The nine UNSURE spells** (reasons in section 3).
5. **More Expertise** at Rogue 6, Bard 9 and Ranger 9. SCOPE-2 says
   "Expertise … no further work; already implemented Expertise stays" and cuts
   Ranger Deft Explorer's Expertise. Does that cover the new picks?
6. **Daylight.** It is cut with Light under DM-3, but it is the counter to
   Darkness (which the game keeps). Keep it for that?
7. **Slow's 25% spell failure** applies to spells with a Somatic component,
   which CLASS-11 removed. Apply it to every spell, or drop it?
8. **Banishment** of extraplanar creatures that never return: count them as
   defeated for XP and loot?

## 1. Shared progression for levels 5–10

### Experience and Proficiency Bonus (Character Advancement table, p. 23)

| Level | XP | Proficiency Bonus | Change |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 4 | 2,700 | +2 | (current cap) |
| 5 | 6,500 | +3 | PB rises |
| 6 | 14,000 | +3 | |
| 7 | 23,000 | +3 | |
| 8 | 34,000 | +3 | |
| 9 | 48,000 | +4 | PB rises |
| 10 | 64,000 | +4 | |

Fixed Hit Points per level (p. 23): Barbarian 7, Fighter/Paladin/Ranger 6,
Bard/Cleric/Druid/Monk/Rogue/Warlock 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 4, each + Con modifier.
A Constitution modifier increase raises maximum HP by 1 per level reached
(p. 23).

### Full casters: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

The five class tables are identical for slots (Bard p. 31, Cleric p. 36,
Druid p. 41, Sorcerer p. 65, Wizard p. 77).

| Level | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | New spell level |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | — | — | **3rd** |
| 6 | 4 | 3 | 3 | — | — | |
| 7 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | — | **4th** |
| 8 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | — | |
| 9 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | **5th** |
| 10 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | |

Sorcerer **Creating Spell Slots** (p. 66): a level 3 slot costs 5 Sorcery
Points (minimum Sorcerer level 5), level 4 costs 6 (level 7), level 5 costs 7
(level 9). No slot above level 5 can be created. Wizard Arcane Recovery
(p. 78) and Land Druid Natural Recovery (p. 46) recover combined levels up to
half the class level (round up), with no slot of level 6+. At level 10 that is
5 levels, so a level 5 slot can now be recovered.

### Half casters: Paladin (p. 53) and Ranger (p. 58)

| Level | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | New spell level |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 5 | 4 | 2 | — | **2nd** |
| 6 | 4 | 2 | — | |
| 7 | 4 | 3 | — | |
| 8 | 4 | 3 | — | |
| 9 | 4 | 3 | 2 | **3rd** |
| 10 | 4 | 3 | 2 | |

New level 2 spells at 5 found only on these lists: **Find Steed** and
**Shining Smite** (Paladin). SPELL-INVENTORY.md already defers both "until
Paladin level 5".

### Warlock Pact Magic (p. 71)

| Level | Pact slots | Slot level | New spell level |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 5 | 2 | 3 | **3rd** |
| 6 | 2 | 3 | |
| 7 | 2 | 4 | **4th** |
| 8 | 2 | 4 | |
| 9 | 2 | 5 | **5th** |
| 10 | 2 | 5 | |

All Pact slots share one level, and lower spells are cast at that level
(p. 71). Slots recover on a Short or Long Rest. Magical Cunning (level 2)
restores up to half the maximum (round up), which is 1 slot.

### Other level 5–10 effects shared across classes

- **Cantrip upgrades at character level 5** (each cantrip's "Cantrip
  Upgrade"): damage dice double (for example Acid Splash p. 107, Fire Bolt
  p. 132), and Eldritch Blast gains a second beam (p. 127). Next step at 11.
- **Ability Score Improvement** (General feat, p. 87): +2 to one score or +1
  to two, maximum 20. It is repeatable. Each class's ASI says "or another
  feat of your choice for which you qualify". The other SRD feats are the
  Origin feats (Alert, Magic Initiate, Savage Attacker, Skilled), Grappler
  (General, dropped by SCOPE-2) and the Fighting Style feats (with the
  Fighting Style feature). Epic Boons need level 19.
- **Species at character level 5** (pp. 84–86; not class features, listed for
  completeness): Dragonborn Breath Weapon 2d10 and Draconic Flight; Goliath
  Large Form (SCOPE-2 cuts it); the level 5 lineage/legacy spells: High Elf
  Misty Step, Wood Elf Pass without Trace (cut by DM-3), Drow Darkness (Drow
  not offered, DROW-1), Abyssal Tiefling Hold Person, Chthonic Ray of
  Enfeeblement, Infernal Darkness.

| 8 | Ability Score Improvement | ASI feat or another feat. | 63 | Choice |

Counts (p. 62): Sneak Attack 3d6 (5–6), 4d6 (7–8), 5d6 (9–10). Repo notes:
AUTO-1 applies Sneak Attack automatically, but Cunning Strike needs a choice
at that moment. DM-1 removed tools, which matters for Poison's Poisoner's Kit.
COVER-1 leaves only Total Cover for Supreme Sneak. Use Magic Device comes at 13.

## 3. Spells of levels 3–5

Lists: B Bard, C Cleric, D Druid, P Paladin, R Ranger, S Sorcerer, K Warlock,
W Wizard (the same letters SPELL-INVENTORY.md uses). "Feature routes" are
always-prepared grants at levels 5–10 with the character level, including
off-list grants (for example, Land Druids get Fireball and Lightning Bolt;
Devotion Paladins get Beacon of Hope). Bard Magical Secrets (10) and Lore
Magical Discoveries (6) open every Cleric, Druid and Wizard spell to Bards
and add no new names. "Conc" is Concentration. Summaries are paraphrased;
read the page before implementing.

Triage key: **KEEP** = resolvable in combat, camp or exploration as the game
stands or with the systems in the summary. **CUT** = needs a DM or a mechanic
the game lacks, using DM-1/DM-2/DM-3 categories. **UNSURE** = a real use
exists but depends on a design decision.

### Level 3 spells (earliest character level: 5)

Higher slots lengthen it and drop Concentration. | **KEEP** | — |
| Blink | 113 | S, W | — | 1 min: at the end of each of the caster's turns roll 1d6; on 4-6 the caster is on the Ethereal Plane (cannot affect or be affected) until the start of its next turn, then returns within 10 ft. | **KEEP** | Ethereal can be modeled as 'off the board' for a round. |

| Counterspell | 120 | S, K, W | — | Reaction when a creature within 60 ft casts: it makes a Con save or the spell fails (its slot is not spent). | **KEEP** | Needs monster casters and a 'casting begins' reaction window (#41). |

| Dispel Magic | 124 | B, C, D, P, R, S, K, W | Devotion 9 | Ends every spell of level 3 or lower on one creature, object or effect within 120 ft; higher spells need a spellcasting check (DC 10 + level); a higher slot auto-ends spells up to its level. | **KEEP** | Needs a registry of ongoing spells per target. |
| Fear | 130 | B, S, K, W | Draconic 5 | Conc 1 min, 30-ft cone, Wis save: Frightened, drops what it holds, Dashes away by the safest route; saves again only when out of line of sight. | **KEEP** | Flight AI exists (Dissonant Whispers); the dropped item conflicts with SIMPLIFY-1. |

| Mass Healing Word | 148 | B, C | Life 5 | Bonus Action: up to six creatures within 60 ft regain 2d4 + modifier HP; +1d4 per slot above 3. | **KEEP** | — |

| Revivify | 159 | C, D, P, R | Life 5 | Touch (300 gp diamond consumed): a creature dead no longer than 1 minute returns with 1 HP. | **KEEP** | Resurrection is kept (SCOPE-2, #175). CLASS-11 removed components, so the diamond cost needs a decision. |
| Sending | 161 | B, C, W | — | A 25-word message to a known creature at any distance, with a reply. | **CUT** | Named in DM-2. |

| Speak with Plants | 164 | B, D, R | — | 10 min: question plants about the last day; toggle plant Difficult Terrain in a 30-ft emanation. | **CUT** | Talking to plants (like Speak with Animals, DM-1); the terrain toggle has little use. |

### Cross-checks done

- Union of the eight printed class lists at levels 3–5: 114 names (42/34/38).
  Count of level 3–5 spell-description headers on pp. 107–175: 114. Every
  description's class tag matches the printed tables (Blight, Animate Dead and
  ten others were checked by hand from a column-cropped extraction because
  the reading-order extraction mixed their columns).
- The Paladin level 3 list (p. 56) is printed with six spells (Create Food and
  Water, Daylight, Dispel Magic, Magic Circle, Remove Curse, Revivify). It is
  confirmed complete in the layout text, not a column split. The Ranger level
  3 list (p. 60) has twelve.
- Text-extraction caveat: on p. 120 the reading-order text mixes Create Food
  and Water with Control Weather. The summary above uses only the Create Food
  and Water sentences. The Reincarnate table (p. 158) did not extract in
  reading order, so it was read from the layout text: 1 roll again,
  2 Dragonborn, 3 Dwarf, 4 Elf, 5 Gnome, 6 Goliath, 7 Halfling, 8 Human,
  9 Orc, 10 Tiefling.
