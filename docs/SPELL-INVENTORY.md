# SRD spell inventory through character level 4

Tracking issue: [#165](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/165). Inventory
baseline: rules **0.6.21**, commit **1e89c1c**. This is a work inventory, not a
claim that the listed spells are implemented. Current delivery adds the
[0.6.22 Wizard Poison Spray path](POISON-SPRAY.md) and
[0.6.23 Cleric Sacred Flame path](SACRED-FLAME.md), and
[0.6.25 Wizard Ray of Frost path](RAY-OF-FROST.md) below.

## Scope and counting

The milestone requires **139 distinct spells: 27 cantrips, 57 level-one spells
and 55 level-two spells**. It covers all twelve SRD classes, their twelve SRD
subclasses, all nine species and their lineages, the four SRD backgrounds, and
eligible SRD feats through character level 4. The baseline has **six partial
playable paths and 133 missing spells**. With 0.6.22 this becomes **seven partial
playable paths and 132 missing spells**. With 0.6.23 there are **eight partial
playable paths and 131 missing spells**. With 0.6.25 there are **nine partial
playable paths and 130 missing spells**; no complete spell conformance is claimed.

Authority: [SRD 5.2.1](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf).
Each spell name below links to its description page. Class-list membership is
recorded separately from additional grant routes: being in a list does not mean
a particular character knows or has prepared the spell. Cantrip choice counts,
spellbooks, preparation, casting ability, acquisition level, free casts and
recharge must remain source-specific.

- Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock and Wizard can access spell levels 0–2
  by class level 4. Paladin and Ranger normal spellcasting reaches only level 1
  in this milestone; their optional styles also grant cantrips.
- Barbarian/Berserker, Fighter/Champion, Monk/Open Hand and Rogue/Thief have no
  intrinsic spell list in this tier. Their species and feat routes still apply.
- Life, Land, Devotion, Draconic and Fiend grants are included at level 3.
  Evoker adds choices from its Wizard list. Lore's additional cross-list spells
  arrive at level 6; Hunter grants no extra spell list here.
- Species level-5 grants, invocations requiring Warlock level 5+, higher-level
  subclasses and Magical Secrets do not add spells to this milestone. Sorcerer
  slot conversion cannot create a level-3 slot before Sorcerer level 5.
  Metamagic still needs its applicable effect/upcasting interactions checked.
- No spell above level 2 is granted by these routes through character level 4.
  Unique level-two Paladin/Ranger spells unavailable through another included
  route (for example Find Steed and Shining Smite) belong to later milestones.
- Scrolls, magic items, monster spellcasting and arbitrary campaign rewards can
  introduce other spells independently of character level. Those content and
  item inventories are separate; this is the class/species/background/feat
  entitlement inventory required by [#165](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/165). Multiclassing remains [#179](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/179)–184.

### Normal class-list cross-check

Counts below reproduce the printed class tables within the level-four limit,
not a character's selection allowance. Description-only additions marked † in
the inventory add Phantasmal Force to Bard, Sorcerer and Wizard, and Mind Spike
to Sorcerer. Thus the complete inventories are 56 Bard, 64 Sorcerer and 81
Wizard entries; the other counts are unchanged. See the source cautions below.

## Additional grant routes

A route tag in a spell row means that spell is eligible for that route; it is
not automatically granted when a feature offers a choice. The normal class
list column intentionally does not absorb subclass or species additions.

| Infernal | Fire Bolt at character level 1; Hellish Rebuke at 3 | 86 | [#73](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/73) |

Acolyte grants Magic Initiate (Cleric) and Sage grants Magic Initiate (Wizard);
Criminal and Soldier do not grant spells. Human's chosen Origin feat can grant
Magic Initiate, as can Warlock's level-2 Lessons of the First Ones. Eligible
level-four feat choices can also grant it. Its repeatability uses different
spell lists, not unrestricted duplication of free uses. See [#61](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/61), [#63](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/63), [#71](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/71), [#75](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/75),
[#82](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/82) and [#161](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/161). Dragonborn, Dwarf, Goliath, Halfling and Orc add no spell names in
this tier; their supernatural abilities are not spells merely because they
produce similar effects. Elf/Tiefling leveled grants retain their own free use
and selected casting ability; [#200](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/200) must preserve those sources independently.

## Delivery and evidence

Every spell needs source-correct targets, components, casting time, resource
costs, range, duration, concentration, effects, defenses, upcasting where
available, grant access and ordinary playable controls. Relevant exploration
uses and camp/inn save continuation are part of completion. No reviewed
adaptation has been approved for any missing spell in this inventory.

Every row depends on the applicable access work ([#36](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/36) and the route issues
above) and component rules ([#39](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/39); [#40](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/40) wherever Materials apply). The Dependencies
column highlights further capabilities, not an exhaustive substitute for the
spell description. [#174](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/174) includes ritual timing/exploration; [#35](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/35) covers needed
conditions/effect semantics; [#43](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/43) covers area targeting. These are capability
trackers: depend on the relevant bounded child, not completion of every spell
in the tracker. Avoid circular dependencies by choosing one representative
spell to prove each new capability.

**Partial** rows link to the existing code and tests below. **Missing** rows have
no spell implementation/conformance test yet. A **queue** entry remains assigned
to [#165](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/165) for decomposition, not a runnable implementation batch. Create its
named child before coding: at most 3–5 straightforward spells using verified
mechanics, or one complex spell with prerequisite children. The first four
new single-spell children are [#202](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/202)–205. Existing [#41](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/41), [#141](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/141), [#146](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/146) and [#166](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/166)–171
are reused rather than duplicated. Closing any one effect issue does not
complete its still-pending class/species/feat integrations.

Higher character levels and slots remain [#176](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/176)–178. Current Somatic restrictions
are covered by [#201](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/201); speech-blocking sources remain [#39](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/39). These existing tests
are evidence of partial behavior, not certification of the full spell.

## Source cautions and verification

The class lists and spell descriptions must be checked together. Phantasmal
Force's description (p. 151) names Bard, Sorcerer and Wizard, but the spell is
missing from all three printed class tables. Mind Spike's description (p. 149)
names Sorcerer in addition to Warlock and Wizard, but the Sorcerer table omits
it. For this inventory, the explicit description grants are retained and marked
† rather than silently excluding them. These add one spell to the 138-name
printed-table union and four class memberships. This is a documented source
interpretation, not a gameplay adaptation or an implemented grant.

Flaming Sphere is labeled Evocation in the Druid/Sorcerer/Wizard lists but
Conjuration in its description (p. 132). This inventory does not silently
resolve that school discrepancy; its implementation child must record a
source-backed decision before school-dependent eligibility is coded.

Inventory verification compared all eight eligible printed class lists with
all level-zero, one and two spell-description headers. That independent pass
found the two class-membership omissions above. All 141 low-level spell
descriptions are accounted for: 139 in this milestone and Find Steed/Shining
Smite deferred until Paladin level 5. Every named additional grant was checked
against the inventory; none adds another name. Every spell has a description
page and every partial spell has code/test evidence. Existing live component definitions independently
confirm the six partial spell IDs. Repository links and issue assignments were
checked; no runtime code or save schema is changed by this inventory.

[#165](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/165) remains open until decomposition, implementations, source-route integration,
independent tests and any explicitly reviewed adaptations satisfy its acceptance.
The inventory alone does not close that tracker or the all-class milestone.
