# First Slums expedition

The shared campaign can leave New Phlan through the western gate, enter the
original Slums map, resolve supported roaming encounters and the four-orc paper
encounter, and return through the same gate. Script-requested combat opens
automatically. Victory resumes the waiting script and exploration; defeat opens
the saved-game reload / Exit to OS screen.

The arena uses the verified 50 by 25 dungeon geometry and original DUNGCOM tiles
described in [combat-geometry.md](combat-geometry.md). Party and enemy placement
is an authored formation inside a shared reachable component of that geometry.
Placement never removes obstacles or omits requested enemies. It is not a claim
to reproduce the original game's formation algorithm.

## Encounter conversion

MON2CHA identities, counts and requested CPIC2 art come from the original script.
The following bounded SRD-compatible profiles are authored conversions, not
complete official monster stat blocks or translations of AD&D statistics:

| Original record | Profile | XP per creature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Kobold | 25 |
| 1, 11 | Kobold leader | 50 |
| 2 | Goblin guard | 50 |
| 3, 12 | Goblin leader | 100 |
| 4, 13 | Orc | 75 |
| 5, 14, 15 | Orc leader | 150 |
| 63 | Bugbear | 200 |

The four-orc event retains its approved 300 XP reward and stable completion
identity. Existing campaign semantics award that amount to each living active
member. Roaming encounters use a distinct persisted reward identity each time.
Original groups can be large and dangerous to a new party; counts are preserved.

The pre-combat menu uses Fight, Wait, Flee, Advance and Parley with the script's
response table. Pre-combat escape is separate from retreat during combat, which
remains deferred. Supported modern profiles have no original party surprise
modifiers. Surprise rolls share the checkpointed ECL random stream; the resulting
surprise uses initiative disadvantage in the selected SRD module. Original
movement thresholds use the explicit conversion 30 modern feet = 12 original
movement units for the menu's escape check.

Coin denominations and carried items are taken from the defeated original
records. The four-orc group carries 96 silver and one magic item from record 13.
The item's original bytes and provenance are retained; no unsupported magic
effect is invented. Script suppression of monster item drops is honored. Full
purses defer collection without losing loot; deferred rewards survive saving.

This does not make every Slums quest, creature, robbery or parley outcome
supported. Unsupported paths retain explicit diagnostics and event rollback.
Probabilistic Slums camping and other district transitions are outside this
first expedition. The first-room victory and required route encounters are the
acceptance target.

## Review and validation

From PowerShell, build with `.\build-rolf.cmd`. Run
`.\review-character.cmd --expedition-check` for the visible automated trip and
`user-data/slums-battlefield.png` capture. The fixture is six equipped level-two
fighters; it does not demonstrate that six new level-one characters can defeat
every original roaming group. Normal play uses `.\review-character.cmd`.

Native tests cover original geometry, host dice, string-copy semantics, surprise
initiative, large-arena checkpoints, coin overflow and duplicate loot. The
installed-data route also checks the four-orc flag, original silver award and
return to New Phlan. Campaign saves retain district, visited maps, script state,
RNG and uncollected loot; version-one saves and the preceding additive rules
content pack remain accepted.
