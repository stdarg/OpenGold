# Weapon mastery delivery packet

## Frozen batch

- Active user goal; one owner, no agents or new issues.
- Deliver all eight mastery properties through actual chosen weapon kinds, with
  creation, advancement, Long Rest replacement, combat and retained saves.
- Original issues: #60 and mastery acceptance of #85/#140/#147/#111/#103.
  Target closure #60/#85; other parent issues close only if their remaining
  original acceptance is independently complete. Do not equate mastery with
  whole-class completion or add missing unrelated class features.
- Current source routes: Fighter/Rogue/Paladin/Ranger levels1–4, Barbarian level1.
  Fighter gains its fourth kind at4. Barbarian's third kind at4 remains part of
  its existing unavailable progression (#104–109), not a new progression batch.
  Higher levels and multiclass remain required in the original goal.
- No starting-equipment packages, ammunition tracking, other conditions/classes,
  unrelated fixes, new UI framework or reduced historical compatibility.
- Requested Astra/high for combat trigger interactions and persistence; actual
  configured model/effort unverified. No model/runtime setting changes. Escalate
  unresolved architecture/rule interpretation and two failed fixes; attempts0.
- Preflight began03:56:03 UTC2026-09-26. Checkpoint04:56:03, latest05:26:03.
  Earlier context-reset boundary is retained; no timing reset.

## Source and acceptance

Official [SRD5.2.1](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf),
printed pp28–29,47–48,54,58–59,62 and90, checked2026-09-26.

| Source | Chosen kinds in this batch | Eligible weapons | Long Rest replacement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Barbarian1 |2|Simple/Martial Melee|At most one kind|
| Fighter1–3 /4 |3 /4|Simple/Martial|At most one kind|
| Paladin1–4 |2|Proficient kinds|Either/both kinds|
| Ranger1–4 |2|Proficient kinds|Either/both kinds|
| Rogue1–4 |2|Proficient kinds|Either/both kinds|

1. Validate counts, duplicate/unknown/unproficient kinds, source and acquisition
   levels in SRD. All38 ordinary catalog weapons are eligible where class rules
   allow; the compatibility Wand is not a weapon choice. Presets pre-generate
   choices; prior saves leave missing selections pending. Existing training,
   wounds, resources, equipment and advancement survive completion/replacement.
2. Cleave: after a melee hit, one additional same-weapon melee attack against a
   different creature within5 feet of the first and the attacker's reach, once
   per turn. Retain negative ability damage; omit positive modifier.
3. Graze: optional miss damage equal to the attack ability modifier, weapon damage
   type; no added weapon/Sneak/style dice or other damage increases. Apply relevant
   typed defenses and zero-damage behavior.
4. Nick: the Light extra attack can use its qualifying Attack action instead of
   the Bonus Action. Share the one extra-attack-per-turn limit with Light; retain
   different physical weapon identity and Two-Weapon Fighting behavior.
5. Push: optional straight-away forced movement up to10 feet, Large or smaller;
   legal reachable destinations, collision and no Opportunity Attack. Declining
   does not refund the triggering attack. Preserve actual occupied cells.
6. Sap: next attack roll has Disadvantage before the source's next turn starts.
   Slow: optional damage-triggered10-foot Speed penalty until that same boundary;
   multiple Slow sources cannot increase its penalty; compose with other effects.
7. Topple: optional Constitution save, DC8+attack ability modifier+proficiency;
   failure Prone. Vex: on damage, source's next attack against this target has
   Advantage before the end of the source's next turn. Consume/expire effects at
   exact boundaries; use shared Advantage/Disadvantage cancellation.
8. Cover misses/hits/zero damage/critical, melee/ranged/thrown/reaction, Action
   Surge, Savage Attacker, Sneak Attack, Champion movement, sizes/obstacles,
   incapacitation/death, PC/NPC ownership, rejected-command atomicity and all
   pending-decision continuation. No mastery from catalog metadata alone.
9. SRD owns grants, outcomes, expiry, targeting and codecs. Core orchestrates
   transactions through generic rules interfaces; UI only presents queries.
   Preserve all released save formats; capture actual0.6.55 writer before edits.
10. Verify normal creation, Review Training, fourth Fighter choice, camp/inn rest
    replacement/save/reload and combat. MainEN/ES and demoEN at1120×800/1920×1080,
    keyboard/mouse, focus, disabled states and Cancel/Escape. Focused native tests,
    then final integrated regression on freshly built targets. Commit/push and
    update coverage before closing only fully proven original issues.

## Approved controls

**MASTERY-1.** Reuse scrollable Training checkbox groups for Weapon Mastery in
creation and Review Training, listing weapon plus mastery name and selection
count. Require class-appropriate counts; preserve Back, lock prior selections in
Review Training, pre-generate presets, keep missing old-save choices pending.
For Fighter4 add a labeled fourth-weapon dropdown below Fighting Style in the
existing Level Up dialog (label y374, selector y406, width652, height38); Confirm
requires it. Cancel/Escape changes nothing; sheet lists selected weapon kinds.

**MASTERY-2.** After a completed Long Rest, use a centered700×670 Weapon Mastery
window for each eligible member, following existing spell choices. Reuse a
scrollable labeled checkbox list, current selections and count/replacement limit.
Keep current/Apply buttons; Escape keeps current; Apply requires a legal complete
set. Choices finish before exploration resumes; camp/inn saving preserves a
pending choice. No combat saving. Interrupted/ineligible rests do not grant a
replacement window; each completed rest grants only one.

**MASTERY-3.** Reuse a centered combat decision dialog for optional Graze, Slow,
Topple, Cleave and Push: show the property/effect and Use/Skip buttons. Cleave's
Use enters existing highlighted creature targeting; Push's Use highlights legal
landing cells up to10 feet directly away. Click/arrows confirm; Escape or Skip
(or the temporarily relabeled End Turn button) declines. Other actions wait;
original Action/Reaction stays spent. Sap/Vex apply automatically as specified.
The dialog is shown only when an optional effect can change the result. All
controls retain keyboard access and standard button styling. No combat saves.

**MASTERY-4.** Add Nick attack beside End Turn, in the otherwise unused ordinary
turn position occupied by Decline during reactions (x208,w174,h36). Show for an
actor with Nick; disable until legal. It opens a centered640×300 selector naming
eligible weapon and melee/ranged/thrown attack, followed by Target/Cancel.
Target uses existing highlighted targeting and keyboard cycle; Escape cancels
before submission. It spends no Bonus Action and shares Light's one-extra-attack
limit. Existing Light Bonus Action choices remain available where legal.

## Evidence and phase record

Preflight confirms mastery currently exists only as weapon catalog metadata;
no runtime mastery grants/effects are implemented. The existing Training,
advancement, rest-spell and combat weapon controls provide reuse routes above.
No production source or UI change is authorized by these proposals alone.

Compatibility preparation verified04:05:58 UTC. Production remains69771eb /
rules0.6.55. Five genuine fixtures and exact replay checks are recorded in
[fixture provenance](../tests/fixtures/README.md#weapon-mastery-baseline--actual-0655-writer).
`opengold_training_tests --mastery-baseline` and the full rebuilt training target
pass; logs `/tmp/mastery-baseline-build.log` and `/tmp/mastery-baseline-tests.log`.
Only tests/documents changed, so no game rebuild or repeated integrated run.
One compile correction (unique ownership) and one fixture correction (two-NPC
party limit); neither failure repeated. No original issue closed by preparation.
All four controls subsequently approved by “1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. Yes. 4. Yes.”
Implementation now proceeds within those boundaries.

### Acquisition implementation checkpoint (WIP)

By04:39 UTC the acquisition paths and pure replacement policy were implemented.
Focused grant/training/advancement/weapon checks pass. MainEN/ES and demoEN
Training, Review Training and Fighter4 ASI checks pass at both supported sizes;
five UI saves match native expectations. Artifacts/logs use `/tmp/mastery-*`.
All50 native targets rebuilt; first regression41/51 passed. Ten older tests need
updated complete-training inputs or conditional profile assertions; compact old
rest-format fixtures retain explicitly pending training. Corrections in progress.
Combat effects and actual Long Rest replacement remain outstanding. This is not
batch delivery, and no original issue has been closed. Timing remains03:56:03
start,04:56:03 checkpoint; no reset. Token/cost measurement unavailable.

Acquisition verification recorded04:44:04 UTC (observed clock; final log records
4.05s test duration): all51 native checks pass after rebuilding50 targets.
`ctest --test-dir build/mac-check --output-on-failure -E '^opengold_godot_' -j6`
produced `/tmp/mastery-native-final.log`; targeted correction builds are in
`/tmp/mastery-regression-*-build.log`. Archery legacy rejection tests deliberately
omit mastery grants so the original Archery boundary remains the cause of failure.
Review found no SRD calculation in Core/UI. Localization972 and diff checks pass.
This acquisition checkpoint is committed on the feature branch; full combat/rest
acceptance and issue closures remain pending.

### Additional combat decisions (pending)

**MASTERY-5.** When mastery and Champion movement trigger simultaneously on a
player-controlled turn, add a labeled Resolve next dropdown above the approved
Use/Skip buttons in the same centered decision dialog. Each entry names an
eligible pending effect. Use/Skip handles only the selected entry, retaining the
others; existing movement/targeting controls resolve the chosen effect. Retain
separate critical-hit movement entitlements from a Cleave critical. Keyboard
access, no action refund, other actions waiting and no combat saves are unchanged.
On enemy turns the game chooses a fixed mastery-before-movement order. Required
UI confirmation under AGENTS.md; simultaneous effects are explicitly within
acceptance row8, so this does not add unrelated trigger systems.

**MASTERY-6.** Proposed Graze interpretation: its ability modifier is the upper
limit on damage. Resistance/Immunity can reduce it; Vulnerability cannot increase
it. For modifier+3, ordinary/vulnerable damage3, resistant1, immune0. This resolves
the wording that Graze damage increases only with its ability modifier against
the general Vulnerability doubling rule. Await user interpretation; do not treat
this proposal as approval.

### 60-minute checkpoint —04:56:24 UTC

Elapsed60m21s from03:56:03. Acquisition committed/pushed as `5b978df`; no original
issue closed. Rest replacement transaction, history replay, conditional campaign18
and approved dialog implemented in WIP. Native five-class PC/NPC tests pass,
including exact prior acquisition-writer replay and later training/advancement.
Combat effects remain unimplemented; MASTERY-5/6 await answers. No scope added.
Live dialog verification exposed checkbox focus loss during list refresh; one
test-timing adjustment did not fix it. The identified cause is hiding/re-showing
all checkboxes during refresh; fix only hides obsolete options. Rebuild and
keyboard verification next. Native API change necessitates final integrated
rebuild; current rest build logs `/tmp/mastery-rest-*-build.log`. No measured
token/cost savings claimed; no new agents/tasks or changed model settings.

### Long Rest implementation evidence (WIP)

Generic RulesModule replacement options/outcomes now drive per-member completed
rest windows. SRD owns eligible kinds, capacity, source preservation and limits.
Core records level/rest-session edits, replays them between advancement records,
and blocks exploration until choices finish. Campaign18 is conditional on a
pending training window or replacement history; older1–17 formats remain accepted.
Review Training adds missing unrelated choices without reverting replacements.
Keeping current consumes the same one-use window and is recorded in history.

Native `mastery_rest_checks.h` passes for all five class routes and PC/NPC owners:
Short/interrupted/ineligible/dead/reserve exclusions, stale/duplicate/invalid
commands, atomic previews, preservation, repeated rests, level1-to4 replay and
Review Training after replacement. The actual prior acquisition writer fixture
round-trips byte-for-byte; see fixture provenance. Final native regression awaits
the50-target rebuild, `/tmp/mastery-rest-native-build.log`.

The shared700×670 dialog and `mastery_rest_view_tests.gd` pass mainEN/ES and demoEN
at1120×800 and1920×1080. Five eligible members follow Wizard spell choices;
keyboard selection/Apply/Escape, sequential windows and pending-codec reload pass.
Screenshots are `/tmp/mastery-rest-{main,demo}-{en,es}-{1120,1920}/`; only main has
Spanish runs. Initial runs exposed a checkbox focus bug (fixed by retaining
visible controls) and test-startup overrides of locale/size (fixed in the script).
Corrected minimum-size Spanish screenshot was inspected; dimensions verified.
Existing full rest-control acceptance passes (`/tmp/mastery-rest-neighbor.log`).
976 localized messages and diff validation pass. These tests verify pending save
serialization, not yet an accessible Save button inside the modal.

**MASTERY-7 (pending control approval).** The approved exclusive modal covers the
existing Save game control. To make unresolved choices saveable through the
player UI, place a standard Save game button at its bottom left (x24,y614,w234,
h40), beside Keep current/Apply. Reuse the existing camp/inn save dialog; return
to the same pending mastery choice after saving or Cancel, with keyboard access.
Saving must not apply or discard the choice; loading retains its entitlement.
No combat saving. This is needed to complete acceptance row10 and MASTERY-2's
pending-save behavior; await approval before adding this control.

Rest verification recorded05:04:27 UTC. Final rebuilt native suite **51/51 PASS**,
4.03s, `/tmp/mastery-rest-native-final.log`. The only initial native regression
failure was the Temporary HP test attempting combat while a new rest choice was
pending; it now verifies rejection, explicitly keeps training, then completes its
original pool-preservation assertions. No production behavior weakened. Corrected
UI runs and existing rest controls pass as described above. Scope/architecture
review confirms rule outcomes stay in the static SRD implementation and Core/UI
only orchestrate/present them. Checkpoint commits do not close #60/#85; combat and
pending Save control approval remain outstanding.

### Sap and Vex combat checkpoint

The static SRD library now applies chosen Sap/Vex properties through the shared
weapon-hit resolver, including selected physical weapons, thrown/Light attacks
and reactions. Sap needs a hit; Vex needs positive damage after typed defenses.
Shared attack modifiers apply/consume Sap on any next attack roll and Vex only
on its scoped source's next roll against that target, including attack spells.
Timers expire at the source's next start (Sap) or next end (Vex), even when
applied during another creature's turn. Reapplication refreshes a source's effect;
other sources retain independent provenance. No mechanic moved into Core/UI.

A pending Savage/Sneak damage choice retains the original effects until its hit
resolves, preserving independently validated roll mode on reload. Resolution
consumes those effects before applying the new hit's mastery. Champion movement
continues afterward. This checkpoint introduces no optional simultaneous-effect
control and does not resolve pending MASTERY-5/6/7.

Conditional FX6 records these two effects; older codecs remain canonical when
neither is present. Legacy module identities reject FX6 in combat and campaign
state. A regression test caught and fixed the combat identity check initially
running before effects were read. Capacity checks reject before spending actions
or RNG; same-source refresh and consumed Vex slots remain usable at the limit.

`tests/mastery_combat_checks.h` exercises every Sap/Vex weapon and supported
attack mode, hits/misses/criticals/immunity, chosen-kind gating, unarmed fallback,
source/scope separation, exact expiry, cancellation, spell attacks, PC/NPC Light
and Surge, reactions, Sneak/Savage/Champion continuation, codec rejection and
bounded storage. The existing status-effect target runs it. Set
`OPENGOLD_MASTERY_FIXTURES=/tmp/mastery-combat-fixtures` when running that target
to export actual production-content before/after checkpoints for the shared UI
harness `tests/mastery_combat_view_tests.gd`. UI uses existing attack controls and
localized sourced conditions; no new layout. Six mastery properties remain.

Verification at05:31 UTC2026-09-26: freshly rebuilt native **51/51 PASS** (13.01s),
`/tmp/mastery-sap-vex-native-final.log`; build50 native targets plus game test
project `/tmp/mastery-sap-vex-native-build.log`, standalone demo
`/tmp/mastery-sap-vex-demo-build.log`.980 localized messages and diff checks pass.
MainEN/ES and demoEN UI/native equality passes at1120×800/1920×1080 using
`mastery_combat_view_tests.gd -- --mastery-fixtures=/tmp/mastery-combat-fixtures
--mastery-captures=/tmp/mastery-combat-main` (add `--mastery-demo` for demo).
Logs `/tmp/mastery-sap-vex-{main,demo}-ui.log`; rendered captures
`/tmp/mastery-combat-{main,demo}`. Small Spanish/main and English/demo captures
were inspected. Main uses the real A action cycle; demo uses its visible Melee
button's Space activation. Both use battlefield target clicks and verify the
visible combat log, exact native state and retained checkpoint continuation.

The harness initially assumed Enter activated an ordinary combat button and
that the main legacy roster was visible. Source/renderer inspection corrected
those assumptions: Enter ends the turn; main status is in the scrollable Log.
No unrelated input/layout behavior was changed. The demo lacks main's A cycle,
so its existing standard button keyboard path is tested instead. Detailed sourced
condition data is supplied to snapshots; this checkpoint does not claim a new
visible condition panel. All mechanics remain inside `opengold_rules_srd5`.

Elapsed batch time at this checkpoint is about95 minutes from03:56:03; the
required60-minute checkpoint above remains the same. Two of eight combat
properties are implemented and tested, acquisition/rest paths were delivered
previously, and zero original issues are closed in this batch. Intermediate
implementation/build phase durations were not recorded separately; native suite
runtime is measured above. No scope, new issue, agent or setting change. Goal
remains active; next independent work is the remaining approved properties.
Final review strengthened the campaign legacy-effect test by first proving that
the identical state is valid under the current identity; rejection cannot be
caused by mismatched HP. Rebuilt status-effect target passes after that test-only
change (`/tmp/mastery-sap-vex-final-test-build.log`). Production sources remain
the same tree that passed the full51 native checks and both UI runs.

### Nick combat checkpoint

Nick uses the actual extra attack's selected weapon kind and physical identity.
Daggers, Light Hammers, Sickles and Scimitars have this property; the source must
have chosen that kind. The SRD resolver shares Light's damage treatment, thrown
ledger, hit choices and once-per-turn allowance. Nick does not spend or restore a
Bonus Action. Taking ordinary Light prevents Nick, taking Nick prevents ordinary
Light, and Action Surge never supplies a second shared extra attack.

Nick remains part of the current Attack action: movement and unrelated Bonus
Actions preserve it; a later non-Attack Action closes it. The ordinary Light Bonus
Action may still be taken later that turn. A subsequent qualifying Attack action
records its own weapon, so Nick cannot use the same weapon merely because a
different weapon qualified during an earlier Action Surge action. These outcomes
stay in `opengold_rules_srd5`; UI consumes supplied options and legal commands.
Source checked: [Nick](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Nick)
and [Attack action](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#AttackAction).

Rules identity0.6.57 introduces conditional combat23 for Nick's explicit shared
allowance and qualifying physical weapon. Formats1–22 remain accepted. Actual
pre-Nick writer0.6.56 fixtures are documented in
[fixture provenance](../tests/fixtures/README.md#nick-shared-budget-baseline--actual0656-writer).
Old in-progress turns remain exact: their Bonus Action flag cannot distinguish
Light from Second Wind. Nick activates at the first fresh turn boundary, after
those historical budgets and pending damage choices have resolved normally.

Approved MASTERY-4 controls use the existing unused ordinary-turn Decline slot
(x208 in main; the corresponding slot in demo), a640×300 labeled selector,
Target/Cancel, mouse and keyboard targeting and Escape cancellation. The modal
presents rules-provided eligible physical weapons and attack modes. The Nick
button stays visible and disabled after expenditure; no combat saving control.
MainEN/ES and demoEN pass at1120×800/1920×1080, including exact UI/native
state, disabled/spent controls, keyboard/mouse, cancellation, thrown Nick and
Nick after an unrelated Bonus Action. The existing Light UI/native checks also
pass on both surfaces at both sizes. Captures `/tmp/nick-{main,demo}` and
`/tmp/nick-light-{main,demo}`; logs `/tmp/mastery-nick-{main,demo}-ui.log` and
`/tmp/mastery-nick-light-{main,demo}.log`.

The final integrated native suite passes **51/51 in8.78s**, with all50 targets
rebuilt after production edits and affected targets rebuilt after test corrections.
Commands: `cmake --build build/mac-check --target <native targets> -j6`, then
`ctest --test-dir build/mac-check --output-on-failure -E '^opengold_godot_' -j6`.
Logs `/tmp/mastery-nick-native-final-build.log`,
`/tmp/mastery-nick-interactions-build.log`, `/tmp/mastery-nick-native-final.log`.
Game/demo builds are `/tmp/mastery-nick-{selection,demo-selection}-build.log`.
UI scripts are [Nick](../tests/nick_view_tests.gd) and
[existing Light](../tests/light_attack_view_tests.gd); use their fixture/capture
arguments with the corresponding main/demo project and `OPENGOLD_GAME_DIR`.
Localization validates988 messages; diff/scope/architecture review passes.

[Native tests](../tests/nick_attack_checks.h) exercise768 weapon/style/ability/seed
combinations plus all five PC/NPC class routes, actual historical continuation,
invalid/stale inputs, Surge timing, physical thrown items, Sneak/Savage choices,
Vex consumption and Champion movement. Regression corrections retained malformed
save rejection and exact historical-body comparisons while accounting for the new
identity/checksum and appended fields. The initial integrated run passed48/51;
further focused checks exposed one additional old tail-field assumption and one
new test that expected Vex consumption before pending damage resolved. Both were
test corrections; no production change was needed in this final verification phase.

Observed verified checkpoint06:06:09 UTC2026-09-26, **2h10m06s** after the original
batch preflight. The60-minute checkpoint above was not reset. Individual earlier
Nick implementation/build phase times were not recorded separately; tokens/cost
unavailable. This commit completes the third of eight combat properties, with
acquisition/rest transactions already delivered. Five properties and pending
MASTERY-5/6/7 remain; zero original issues closed. No scope expansion, new issues,
settings changes or delegation. The goal remains active.


### Optional choice compatibility preparation

Observed06:10:34 UTC2026-09-26. Production remains0bba07e/rules0.6.57. Actual
Longbow/Maul Champion critical checkpoints now cover the attack, Savage decision,
free movement and settled state; all eight round trips and three-step replays
match byte-for-byte. Rebuilt `opengold_status_effect_tests` passes; logs
`/tmp/mastery-choice-baseline-{build,capture,test}.log`. This changes tests and
provenance only, with no new playable property or issue closure. See
[fixture provenance](../tests/fixtures/README.md#optional-mastery-choices-baseline--actual0657-writer).

MASTERY-5/6/7 were re-presented as visible questions1–3 with the Glass alert
(exit0); no answer has arrived. Integration of simultaneous mastery/Champion
choices needs MASTERY-5. Graze policy and rest Save control need6/7. Keep those
pending; do not infer their approval from the earlier four-item response.
