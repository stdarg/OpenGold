# Wizard spell access

Issue [#199](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/199) separates knowledge
from preparation for the existing playable Wizard spells. It is the first part
of [F07 #36](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/36), not complete Wizard
spellcasting. Authority: [SRD 5.2.1 pp. 77–78](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf#page=77).

## Implemented scope

Rules 0.6.22 adds explicit Fire Bolt/Poison Spray starting cantrip choices through
the approved Spell Choices step. Preset Wizards receive both available cantrips;
old saves retain historical selections. Missing catalog choices stay pending.
Magic Missile remains a spellbook entry and prepared spell. See
[Poison Spray](POISON-SPRAY.md) for this increment and its open integrations. Existing advancement
selections can also learn Scorching Ray and Blindness from Wizard level 3.
Changing those selections retains every previously learned book entry and its
first acquisition level. An unprepared book entry cannot be cast. Known cantrips
remain available with no slots; a prepared leveled spell still spends a slot.
An explicitly empty Wizard preparation no longer silently enables Magic Missile.

The rules module derives `SpellAccess` from the existing `FeatureGrant` ledger
and `CharacterSheet.prepared_spells`. Each spell grant has an ID, the source
`class:wizard:spellcasting`, an acquisition level, and an `access` choice of
`cantrip` or `spellbook`. Validation rejects duplicates, wrong sources,
unavailable acquisition levels, malformed choices, and preparation of a spell
absent from the book. No pointer ownership or additional runtime is introduced.

| Wizard level | Cantrip entitlement | Total book selections from levels | Prepared entitlement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 6 | 4 |
| 2 | 3 | 8 | 5 |
| 3 | 3 | 10 | 6 |
| 4 | 4 | 12 | 7 |

These capacities remain explicit even though the current catalog cannot fill
them. New book selections are limited to six at level 1 and two per later
level, with spell level checked at acquisition. Existing Modifiers text shows
known cantrips, book entries/acquisition levels, and pending counts in English
and Spanish. It does not select missing spells on the player's behalf.

## Cleric extension

Rules 0.6.23 adds a sourced starting Sacred Flame choice using the same control.
Cleric grants use `class:cleric:spellcasting`; the base cantrip entitlement is
3 through level 3 and 4 at level 4. Presets receive the supported choice, while
old saves retain their recorded spells. Leveled preparation, Divine Order and
level-up replacement remain #91. See [Sacred Flame](SACRED-FLAME.md).

## Persistence

Module **0.6.24** writes **PC13** combat recipes; the existing grant section
contains the spell sources and the casting mask must agree with them. Campaign
format **11** stores explicit starting cantrip choices. Combat format **13** and
vital-state formats **SRD1–7** remain. PC10 reads retain their historical grants.
Campaigns replay creation and recorded advancement to reconstruct knowledge,
then validate their grant ledger. Old campaigns recover the established preset
and spells actually selected in that history, including now-unprepared spells.
Missing choices remain pending. Loading does not replenish resources or roll dice.

Older PC1–9 combat recipes lack book history, so internal checkpoint migration
retains their recorded casting access. It neither invents knowledge nor accepts
new spell grants disguised as an older recipe. Frozen **0.6.18** writer files
verify exact old combat continuation. Campaign saves and reloads preserve wounds,
equipment, spent slots, Hit Dice, Adrenaline Rush, Temporary HP and clocks.
Player saving remains restricted to camping or an inn.

## Remaining work

The [level-four spell inventory](SPELL-INVENTORY.md) enumerates all required
spells and their source routes. The five Wizard spells described here are only
a subset of that catalog; missing choices are not evidence of a smaller SRD
entitlement.

- [#37](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/37): full learning and
  preparation controls and filling pending choices. This increment retains the
  existing advancement selection flow; it does not add a Long Rest editor.
- [#97](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/97): copying costs/time,
  book objects, replacement books and the complete Wizard preparation lifecycle.
- [#200](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/200): independent free casts,
  source-specific use/recharge and an actual granting feature. No reserved
  free-cast fields or test-only grants are counted as support.
- Other class policies, all missing spells, rituals and subclass grants remain
  their named increments. Parent #36 stays open.

## Verification

`spell_access_tests.cpp` covers the independent entitlement table, knowledge
retention, actual casting, slot exhaustion, empty preparation, invalid grants,
atomic advancement/preview, campaign replay and prior-writer continuation.
Existing native save/resource/equipment regressions independently expect only
the two old preset grants to be added to their frozen Wizard ledgers.
`localization_tests.gd` creates a Wizard through existing controls and checks
the translated knowledge, source level and pending counts in Modifiers.
