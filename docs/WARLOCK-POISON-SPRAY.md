# Level-one Warlock Poison Spray

Rules 0.6.39 delivers [#227](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/227), a child
of [Poison Spray #202](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/202) and
[Pact Magic #160](https://github.com/stdarg/OpenGold/issues/160).
Authority: [SRD 5.2.1 pp.75,153](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf).

The approved Q26 Warlock Spell Choices pattern now lists Eldritch Blast and Poison
Spray. Players can fill both starting cantrip choices; new presets pre-generate
both. Missing choices remain pending under the existing selection policy. Saved
characters retain their recorded choices without automatically learning the newly
available spell. No independent control layout or behavior was introduced.

Poison Spray records a level-one `class:warlock:pact_magic` cantrip grant. The
existing spell rules use the Warlock's Charisma plus proficiency for a ranged
spell attack against a living creature within 30 feet, dealing 1d12 Poison on a
hit. Criticals, typed defenses, line of effect, adjacent-hostile Disadvantage,
Somatic hands and armor restrictions use the existing implementation. Only the
Magic action is spent. The approved Spell dropdown/Cast can choose either learned
cantrip; ally targeting preserves party selection and keyboard access.

PC27 admits the Warlock Poison Spray mask/source combination. Campaign 11,
combat 13–15 and FX1–3 are unchanged. Earlier recipe policies and module identities
reject this new source. Actual 0.6.38 writer fixtures at `3b7e943` preserve the
old single-cantrip selection, wound/wealth/random state, spent Dash/Adrenaline
Rush and subsequent Eldritch Blast attack exactly. No player combat saving was
introduced; normal rest/save behavior retains both newly chosen spells.

Evidence: [native Warlock grant/attack/persistence checks](../tests/warlock_poison_checks.h)
run in the existing [cantrip harness](../tests/eldritch_blast_tests.cpp), alongside
[creator](../tests/warlock_cantrip_view_tests.gd) and
[combat](../tests/eldritch_view_tests.gd) checks. Native cases independently verify
Charisma 18 rather than Intelligence 15, d12 12 versus the same seed's d10 8,
critical/miss/typed defenses, rejection without mutation, explicit choices,
PC/NPC campaign handoff, Short/Long Rest save-reload and actual prior continuation.

This is the currently playable **Warlock level-one** source, not proof of Warlock
levels two through four or full Pact Magic. Those remain #160. Parent #202 retains
Druid #152, Sorcerer #132, High Elf #67, Abyssal Tiefling #73, Magic Initiate #75,
Tome #161, Magician #152 and Druidic Warrior #147 integrations, plus remaining
speech/component enforcement #39. The Wizard levels 1–4 path remains documented
in [Poison Spray](POISON-SPRAY.md). Higher scaling stays #176–178.

Verification: all 43 native/tool checks and 19 headless Godot checks plus ten
native prerequisites pass. The asset-backed Warlock creator and bilingual combat
checks pass, with English/Spanish renders at 1120×800 and 1920×1080. Both native
extensions build; 825 localization messages validate. Logs:
`/tmp/warlock-poison-regression.log`, `/tmp/warlock-poison-creator.log`,
`/tmp/warlock-poison-combat-render.log`; renders:
