# OpenGoldBox contributor guidance

- Use RAII for every owned resource in native code.
- Do not represent ownership with raw pointers. Prefer value types and standard
  RAII containers; when pointer semantics are necessary, use `std::unique_ptr`
  by default and `std::shared_ptr` only for genuine shared ownership.
- After updating this repository, commit your changes and push the current branch
  to `origin`, unless the user explicitly asks otherwise. Include only your own
  changes and complete relevant checks before committing.

## Scope and review boundaries

- Answer questions and provide suggestions without treating them as
  authorization to make changes.
- A design request authorizes a written proposal, diagrams, and static
  layout sketches. It does not authorize coding.
- Do not create prototypes, applications, scripts, or launchers for a
  design request.
- When a design is requested for review, deliver it and stop for
  comments. Wait for explicit authorization before implementation.
- Commit/push instructions govern authorized changes; they do not
  expand the scope of a task.

## Technology decisions

- Read docs/TECH.md and the relevant requirements before selecting
  an implementation approach.
- Follow OpenGoldBox's established Godot 4.x, C++20, and GDExtension
  architecture and documented language boundaries.
- Keep SRD mechanics in the statically linked `opengold_rules_srd5` library.
  Core depends on `opengold_rules` interfaces, never the SRD implementation;
  the application selects and injects the implementation. Core owns campaign
  orchestration and transactions; the rules module decides rule outcomes.
  Do not duplicate SRD calculations or decision branches in Core or UI.
- Reuse existing components, build tools, and launch conventions.
- Do not introduce another UI stack, runtime, or framework without
  explicit user approval, including for prototypes and review tools.
- Skills and available tools must serve the project's requirements.
  Their availability does not authorize a technology substitution.
- Report specific blockers instead of silently changing technologies.
- Before committing, verify scope and architecture compliance as
  well as functional correctness.

## Time and communication

- Keep responses concise and investigation proportional to the task.
- Do not perform speculative or unrelated work.
- Provide commands appropriate to the user's actual shell.
- Ask numbered questions to confirm UI layout and control behavior before
  making independent choices about them.

## Efficient SRD work

- Start with `docs/SRD-HANDOFF.md`, then follow `docs/SRD-WORKFLOW.md`.
  Use `docs/SRD-REPO-MAP.md` for targeted navigation and
  `docs/SRD-DECISIONS.md` for approvals; do not reload the whole history.
- Keep one delivery batch active, with fixed acceptance criteria and one
  implementation owner per requirement. Batch related issues/source routes;
  preserve their full acceptance. Use the existing backlog grouping in
  `docs/SRD-BATCHING-REVIEW.md`. A checklist is the default; report newly
  discovered work separately rather than automatically creating more issues.
  This execution policy supersedes older mandatory ticket-splitting language;
  it does not supersede feature requirements or review boundaries.
- Freeze the batch's player-visible outcome, included issues, acceptance and
  exclusions before coding. Never silently expand scope. Defer discoveries
  outside that boundary; if one blocks delivery, explain the dependency and ask
  for explicit approval before implementing it. Necessity is not authorization.
  Routine implementation choices within accepted scope need no repeated approval.
- Keep at most one explicitly approved out-of-scope prerequisite active, with a
  return path. No speculative foundations, unrelated fixes or tooling projects.
- Finish edits to a build's inputs before starting it. Do not edit source,
  headers or generated inputs consumed by a running build. After a code change,
  rebuild affected targets before testing; choose targets that avoid unneeded
  packaging/export work.
- Search with `rg`, then read bounded sections. Reuse current evidence and
  snapshots; refresh affected issues when their state matters. Keep full logs
  outside conversation and return failures or summaries, not truncated dumps.
- Use `docs/SRD-COVERAGE.md` as the completion record. Handoff holds only current
  state; feature docs hold mechanics/evidence. Link records instead of copying
  delivery narratives. Record tested revision, commands and material limitations.
- Run focused checks during development; broader required checks on the final
  integrated changes. Never use stale binaries or weaken verification. Preserve
  released-save compatibility; no unapproved reduction in supported history.
- Use the compact batch card in `docs/SRD-WORKFLOW.md`; record phase timings
  and a checkpoint 60 minutes after starting, no later than 90 minutes.
  Measure delivered original requirements, not child-ticket count. Do not
  fabricate past timings or promise a speedup before measuring it.
- Batch related UI questions and reuse approved patterns within their recorded
  scope. Play `/usr/bin/afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff` before questions.
  Write each question visibly in the conversation; a question widget alone is
  insufficient. A decision reply or workflow maintenance does not resume a paused goal.
- New tasks, parallel agents and changes to compatibility require explicit
  authorization. Carry a compact handoff at authorized task boundaries. Do not
  change model/runtime settings as an incidental optimization.

## UI controls

- Make interactive elements visibly recognizable as controls. Buttons must look
  like buttons, and selectable rows must visibly communicate that they can be
  selected; do not present actions as indistinguishable plain text.
- Use consistent standard control styling with clear boundaries, readable
  contrast, padding, and distinct hover, pressed/selected, disabled, and keyboard
  focus states. Preserve keyboard access and clear labels.
- Apply this rule to new screens and when updating existing UI. Confirm layout
  and control behavior with numbered questions as required above.
